***some useful Stata shortcuts on Windows:
* CTRL + L 			: select line 
* CTRL + D 			: run selected block 
* CTRL + R 			: run entire file
* CTRL + S + Shift	: save (as)

***Stata suggestions***
* - run entire do-file at once, program using local (and if necessary global) macros 
* - use "tab" to make code easier to read.  
* - use "pauses" in your code when necessary
* - use many comments of the type /*sometext*/ after a line of code or ***sometext*** for headings
* - use forward slash "/" only for directories - this is then the same on Mac and Windows
