## this is the description to the STATA .do file HRSg2agingToPanel.
# the file HRSg2agingToPanel was created by Castor Comploj to help researchers prepare a panel dataset using retirement data from the HRS-type harmonized surveys prepared by the gateway2aging.org at the University of Southern California. 
# I thank the team at g2aging for the great work on efficiently harmonizing the data across countries. 
# The current file is meant to facilitate researchers further, by reducing error and time invested into data preparation. Within a few hours of preparation, you should have a useable panel dataset prepared.
