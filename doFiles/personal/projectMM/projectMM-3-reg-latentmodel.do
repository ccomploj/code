/*
meologit and gllamm are both Stata commands that can be used to estimate ordered logit models with unobserved heterogeneity, but they differ in their underlying estimation approach and capabilities.
meologit uses maximum likelihood estimation and is part of Stata's built-in capabilities. It is generally faster and more efficient for simpler models.
gllamm (generalized linear latent and mixed models) is a user-written program that uses quasi-likelihood methods. It is more flexible and can handle more complex model specifications, such as correlated random effects, non-normal mixtures, and heteroskedastic errors. However, it can be slower and less stable for simpler models.
In summary, meologit is the simpler and more efficient choice for basic mixed-effects ordered logit models, while gllamm offers more advanced capabilities but at the cost of increased complexity and potentially longer estimation times.
