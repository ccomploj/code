        "**Understanding Bag-of-Words (BoW) Analysis**\n",
        "\n",
        "In the realm of Natural Language Processing (NLP), it's crucial to remember that computers inherently do not understand text as humans do. Instead, they comprehend numbers. Therefore, the first step in teaching machines our languages is to convert text into a numerical format, a process known as vectorization.\n",
        "\n",
        "One of the simplest and most common methods of vectorizing text is the Bag-of-Words (BoW) model. In BoW analysis, each document or sentence is transformed into a vector of numbers. Each number in this vector represents the count of a specific word within the corpus. This approach allows the machine to process and analyze text data by focusing on the frequency of words, thereby enabling it to identify patterns and make predictions based on textual input.\n",

        "## Term Frequency (TF)\n",
        "**Term Frequency (TF)** is a fundamental concept in text analysis and Natural Language Processing (NLP). It represents a document as a vector, where each element quantifies the importance of a word based on its frequency within that document. The more frequently a word appears in a document, the higher its TF value, indicating its potential significance in the context of that document.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "**Why is TF important?**\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Feature Extraction**: TF is crucial for converting text data into numerical data, which can be used as input for machine learning models. By representing text as vectors, TF allows algorithms to process and analyze textual information.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Identifying Key Topics**: In a large corpus, words with high TF values can help identify the main topics or themes of a document. For example, in a news article about climate change, words like \"climate,\" \"carbon,\" and \"emissions\" might have high TF values, highlighting the article's focus.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Improving Search Relevance**: Search engines use TF to rank documents based on the relevance of search queries. A document with a high TF for a search term is more likely to be relevant to the user's query. ##!!!!\n",
        "\n",
        "**Example**: Consider a document about machine learning. If the word \"algorithm\" appears 15 times in a 100-word document, its TF is 0.15. This high frequency suggests that \"algorithm\" is a significant term in understanding the document's content."

        "\n",
        "For example, the second most common word will appear approximately half as often as the most common word, the third will appear one-third as often, and so on. This phenomenon is often observed in natural language processing and text analysis, where a few words dominate the text while the rest are used infrequently.\n",

        "\n",
        "TF-IDF stands for Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency. It is a numerical measure that helps us understand the importance of a word in a document relative to a collection of documents, also known as a corpus. This measure is crucial in text analysis and information retrieval.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Components of TF-IDF:**\n",
        "- **Term Frequency (TF):** This measures how frequently a term appears in a document. The more times a word appears in a document, the higher its TF value.\n",
        "- **Inverse Document Frequency (IDF):** This measures how important a term is. While TF is about frequency, IDF is about rarity. If a word appears in many documents, its IDF is lower, indicating it is less unique.\n",
        "\n",
        "The TF-IDF value is calculated by multiplying the TF and IDF values. A high TF-IDF score indicates that the term is very important to the document it appears in, and not common across the entire corpus.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Visual Representation:**\n",
        "Below is a visual representation of the TF-IDF formula:\n",
        "\n",
        "<img src=\"http://www.tiesdekok.com/EAA_2018_NLP/images/TFIDF_equation.PNG\" alt=\"TF-IDF Formula\" width=\"500\"/>\n",
        "\n",
        "**Example of TF-IDF in Action:**\n",
        "To better understand how TF-IDF works, consider the following example:\n",
        "\n",
        "<img src=\"https://d1avok0lzls2w.cloudfront.net/uploads/blog/5445d032e97981.23456174.jpg\" alt=\"TF-IDF Example\" width=\"500\"/>\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",

        "- `lowercase=True`: Converts all text to lowercase before processing. This ensures that words like \"The\" and \"the\" are treated as the same word.\n",
        "- `use_idf=True`: Enables inverse document frequency (IDF) weighting. IDF reduces the weight of common words and increases the weight of rare words.\n",
        "- `smooth_idf=True`: Adds 1 to the document frequencies when calculating IDF, preventing division by zero and smoothing the IDF values.\n",
        "- `stopwords=\"english\"`: Removes common English stopwords (e.g., \"the\", \"a\", \"is\") from the text. Stopwords are frequent words that usually don't contribute much to the meaning of a document.\n",
        "\n",
        "Removing stopwords is a crucial step in text analysis because it helps to focus on the more meaningful words in the corpus.  The following code demonstrates how to identify the top TF-IDF terms after stopword removal:\n",
        "\n",
        "This code snippet first initializes a `TfidfVectorizer` with `stop_words='english'` to automatically remove English stopwords.  Then, it calculates the TF-IDF matrix, sums the TF-IDF values for each term across all documents, and prints the top N terms with the highest TF-IDF values.  This provides a clear view of the most important terms in your corpus after stop words have been filtered out."

        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "The authors opted for Jaccard similarity because it focuses on the presence or absence of words rather than their frequency. Here’s why this approach is more suitable for their analysis:\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Binary vs. Frequency-Based Comparison:**  \n",
        "  - **Jaccard Similarity:**  \n",
        "    - Treats documents as sets of unique words and calculates similarity as the ratio of shared words (intersection) to the total unique words (union).  \n",
        "    - Ignores how frequently a word appears, making it ideal for detecting if key terms are simply present or absent.  \n",
        "  - **Cosine Similarity:**  \n",
        "    - Considers documents as term frequency vectors and measures the cosine of the angle between these vectors, thus incorporating word frequency and repetition.  \n",
        "    - Can dilute the impact of subtle changes, as it blends the frequency information with the overall distribution of words.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Use Case Suitability:**  \n",
        "  - Jaccard similarity is especially useful when the analysis aims to capture the mere presence or absence of critical terms. In the context of corporate disclosures, the removal or absence of specific words may carry significant meaning regarding a firm's performance, independent of how often those words appear.  \n",
        "  - Cosine similarity, while effective for measuring the overall similarity in word usage patterns, may not highlight such binary changes as clearly because it is influenced by the magnitude of word frequencies.\n",
        "\n",
        "Thus, by using Jaccard similarity, the study targets changes in vocabulary—specifically, whether important words are dropped from the reports—which can serve as a subtle yet potent indicator of adverse news for the firm.\n"

        "## Convert Corpus to Sentences\n",
        "\n",
        "For word2vec, it's generally best to break your text down into sentences rather than using whole documents. Here's why:\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Local Context is Key:**  \n",
        "  Word2vec relies on a sliding window over a sequence of tokens to capture local contextual relationships. When you break your text into sentences, the words within each sentence are more likely to be contextually related. This helps the model learn more accurate word associations.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Avoiding Unrelated Contexts:**  \n",
        "  If you use entire documents—especially long ones—the context window might span across different topics or sentence boundaries. This can mix unrelated words together and potentially reduce the quality of your embeddings.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Implementation Expectations:**  \n",
        "  Many word2vec implementations, like Gensim’s Word2Vec, are designed to work with lists of sentences (each sentence being a list of tokens). Using sentences ensures that the data is structured in a way that the algorithm expects, which can lead to better performance.\n",
        "\n",
        "In summary, while you might get acceptable results using documents in some cases (especially if your documents are short and cohesive), breaking your text into sentences is typically the more effective approach for capturing the true semantic relationships between words."

        "In the world of natural language processing, one powerful technique is to expand a small set of `seed words` into a larger set of related words. This process is known as seed expansion. By identifying words that are most similar to our initial seed words, we can create a custom dictionary that captures the nuances and variations of a particular concept or theme.\n",
        "\n",
        "For example, if we start with a seed word like \"growth,\" we can use word embeddings to find other words that are closely related, such as \"expansion,\" \"increase,\" or \"development.\" These related words can then be added to our custom dictionary.\n",
        "\n",
        "Once we have our expanded dictionary, we can perform dictionary analysis. This involves using the dictionary to analyze text data, identifying the presence and frequency of the words in our dictionary. This can be particularly useful in fields like finance, where understanding the language and sentiment around concepts like \"growth\" or \"decline\" can provide valuable insights.\n",
        "\n",
        "By leveraging seed expansion and custom dictionary creation, we can enhance our text analysis capabilities and gain a deeper understanding of the language used in specific domains.\n"

(Operator Instructions) And as a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to our host, Susan Lisa. Please go ahead.     Thank you, Tanya. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us. With me on today's call are Mike Mahoney, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Dan Brennan, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. We issued a press release earlier this morning announcing our Q2 2017 results, which included reconciliations of the non GAAP measures used in the release. We have posted a copy of that release as well as reconciliations of non GAAP measures used in today's call to the Investor Relations section of our website under the heading Financial Information. The duration of our call will be approximately 1 hour. Mike will provide strategic and revenue highlights of Q2 '17. Dan will review the financials for the quarter and then Q3 '17 and full year 2017 guidance, and then we'll take your questions. During today's QA session, Mike and Dan will be joined by our Chief Medical Officers, Dr. Ian Meredith and Dr. Ken Stein. Before we begin, I'd like to remind everyone that on the call, organic revenue growth is defined as excluding the impacts of changes in foreign currency exchange rates and sales from the acquisition of EndoChoice and Symetis over the relevant prior year period. Also note, this call contains forward looking statements within the meaning of federal securities laws, which may be identified by words like anticipate, expect, believe, estimate and other similar words. They include, among other things, statements about our growth and market share; new product approvals and launches; clinical trials; cost savings and growth opportunities; our cash flow and expected use; our financial performance, including sales, margins, earnings and other Q3 and full year 2017 guidance; as well as our tax rates, RD spend and other expenses. Actual results may differ materially from those discussed in the forward looking statements. Factors that may cause such differences include those described in the Risk Factors section of our most recent 10 K and subsequent 10 Qs filed with the SEC. These statements speak only as of today's date, and we disclaim any intention or obligation to update them. At this point, I'll turn it over to Mike for his comments. Thanks, Mike.     Thank you, Susie, and good morning, everyone. Boston Scientific delivered strong results again in the second quarter of '17. Organic revenue growth of 6% and operational revenue growth of 7% were ahead of both expectations and underlying market growth rates. It was an excellent quarter in light of a challenging 10% organic revenue growth comparison in the second quarter of '16. These results are also a reflection of our strong execution and success of our category leadership strategy. We leveraged that 7% revenue growth to deliver 18% adjusted EPS growth or a $0.32 per share and $0.01 above Wall Street consensus. If you exclude the $0.02 negative impact of foreign exchange, adjusted EPS grew 24% year over year. Key to this very high level of EPS growth was a 260 basis point year over year improvement in adjusted operating margin to 26%, led by a strong 72.8% gross margin result and a 40 basis point reduction year over year in SGA spending to 35.5% of revenue. Also, as detailed on our Investor Day last month, we aim to deliver this type of consistent revenue growth and double digit adjusted EPS growth over the long term. We continue to enhance the growth profile of the company, with plans to enter the $13 billion in new high growth markets across our businesses over the next few years. Importantly, we believe Boston Scientific continues to be uniquely positioned to drive shareholder value and differentiated EPS growth due to our revenue growth profile, opportunity to improve operating margins and a strengthening balance sheet. We're also excited about the second half of '17 and our plans to build upon our global momentum and drive sustainable long term growth in '18 and beyond. We're raising our full year 2017 operational revenue growth guidance to an estimated 7% growth with a 6% to 8% range, which includes an approximate 120 basis point full year contribution from the EndoChoice and Symetis acquisitions. We're also raising our full year adjusted EPS guidance by $0.01, from the previous range of $1.22 to $1.26, to a revised range of $1.23 to $1.27, representing 11% to 14% earnings growth. Importantly, this revised EPS guidance includes an expected $0.08 negative impact or approximate 700 basis point headwind from foreign exchange. I'll now provide some highlights on Q2 '17 results and thoughts on our second half '17 outlook. In my remarks, all references to growth are on an organic year over year constant currency basis, unless otherwise specified. Our Q2 organic revenue growth of 6% continues to be broad based across our product lines, with most of our businesses growing faster than the underlying markets. MedSurg grew an impressive 10%; Cardiovascular, 5%; and Rhythm Management, 3%. We also delivered a strong balanced organic growth across geographies, led by a 7% revenue growth in the U.S. and EMEA, 14% in emerging markets and 20% growth specifically in China. In Europe, our business was impacted from the Lotus recall, yet they still delivered 2% growth in the quarter. Turning to a few MedSurg highlights. The 3 MedSurg businesses delivered an impressive 10% organic revenue growth and 12% operational growth, including the recently acquired EndoChoice. In Endoscopy, organic revenue grew 7% in the quarter and 12% including the acquisition, led by the strength of our franchises in hemostasis, pathology and endoluminal surgery. Of note, in hemostasis, we're seeing faster than expected conversion to our new Resolution 360 Clip platform, which led to mid teens growth for the franchise. Regionally, Endo results were particularly strong in the U.S. and Latin America. 7 months after closing the EndoChoice acquisition, we have completed the sales integration, and revenue is slightly ahead of plan, contributing to 80 basis points of total growth in the quarter. We continue to be pleased with the results from our expanding presence in pathology, infection control and prevention and the ambulatory surgeries in our market. Additionally, our recently signed agreement with Total Scope allows us to offer convenient scope repair services to this important customer base. Our Uro and pelvic health business have continued the strong performance that grew 10% in the quarter, led by our single use digital LithoVue ureteroscope and products to treat men's health and pelvic floor conditions. This 10% growth is particularly impressive considering an 18% growth comparison in second quarter '16. So overall, the Uro health business grew double digit in the U.S., EMEA and Latin America. And emerging market sales were also very strong, led by our Stone and men's health franchises. LithoVue remains an important driver for our urology business, providing single use digital visualization and navigation capabilities to diagnose and treat stones and other conditions of the kidney, ureter, while avoiding the needs for repairs or sterilization that can be a very big challenge with reusable scopes. LithoVue is now in more than 900 accounts worldwide, and we're seeing faster growth and pull through of our core kidney stone business with customers that use LithoVue. We continue to see important research studies that support the trend towards single use systems, which bodes well for the longer term outlook. And the FDA also recently determined that manufacturers of certain reusable medical devices now need to include validation data regarding cleaning, disinfection and sterilization. We remain very encouraged by the LithoVue opportunity. Turning to Neuromod. Revenue in Neuromodulation grew 14% in the second quarter, driven by multiple new product launches, including the Montage MRI system and the Artisan full body MRI paddle and spinal cord stimulation as well as the Vercise Gevia MRI Deep Brain Stimulation System in Europe. Gevia features our Neural Navigator 2 with STIMVIEW Technology, which allows clinicians to visualize the stimulation field while customizing DBS stimulation programs for patients. We expect to launch into the U.S. DBS market by year end '17 or early '18, followed by our traditional   followed by our directional lead in MRI conditioning label in 2018. It's really an exciting time in spinal cord stimulation as we recently published Illumina 24 month data, and the PROCO randomized controlled trial data was presented at INS. The PROCO data showed that frequency is not a determining factor in spinal cord stimulation pain relief. 1 kilohertz therapy had equivalent results to 10 kilohertz, and Boston Scientific Precision Spectra uses 1 kilohertz and thus uses 2/3 less energy than high frequency systems with the equivalent outcomes for pain relief. This reinforces the need and benefit for flexible technology platforms like Spectra that can enable physicians to customize therapy for the unique pain patients. Turning to our Cardiovascular group. The Cardiovascular group grew 5% in the second quarter '17 against a very tough 13% growth comparison in second quarter '16. So starting off with our PI business. Peripheral Interventions in the quarter grew 7%, a particularly strong performance in Asia and Europe, led by sales of our stent portfolio, our next generation Innova Stent for the SFA, drug eluting Eluvia stents in Europe and WALLSTENT. We also saw strong growth from our atherectomy JetStream platform and are promising initial launch of our OPTICROSS intravascular ultrasound platform for peripheral applications. Drug eluting technologies contributed nicely to European growth. And in the U.S., enrollment in the IDE trial for Ranger DCB continues on pace. We also wait 12 month follow up for an IMPERIAL trial for Eluvia drug eluting stents. In Interventional Cardiology, that business grew second quarter organic revenue of 4% and operational revenue of 5% despite the impact of the Lotus recall in Europe. Our growth was led by strong sales of our WATCHMAN Left Atrial Appendage Closure Device, mid teens revenue growth in PCI Guidance, mid single digit growth in Complex PCI and early contributions from the Symetis ACURATE platform in Europe. The WATCHMAN platform had another excellent quarter and continues to build global momentum. We're focused on market development activities such as deploying therapy awareness reps, increasing our medical education programs, social media outreach and direct to patient awareness programs. We remain on track to end '17 with 350 to 375 U.S. centers. We also achieved an important clinical milestone in WATCHMAN by completing the enrollment in SALUTE trial. This trial is specifically designed to pursue regulatory approval in Japan. And we target mid '19 Japan approval for WATCHMAN. Global DES sales in the quarter were up 1% despite a challenging 9% growth comparison in second quarter '16, led by our differentiated SYNERGY platform. Products for Complex PCI procedures grew in the upper mid single digits, led by strong atherectomy and cutting balloon sales. Our PCI Guidance business continues to build momentum with strong IVUS sales and the launch of our integrated fractional flow reserve platform. On Lotus. Lotus remediation work remains on track. We expect Lotus to return to the EU market by year end '17 and a fourth quarter submission of our U.S. PMA for regulatory approval in the U.S. We continue to estimate a mid '18 launch in the U.S. 9 weeks post closing, we're on track with our Symetis integration plans, including training of our Uro TAVR field reps on the ACURATE valve platform. As highlighted at our recent Investor Day conference, we believe that our company will be uniquely and ideally positioned to address the needs of physicians and patients with our differentiated TAVR portfolio. There's no change to our clinical trial priorities, including pursuing ACURATE in the U.S. and Japan, and a Lotus intermediate risk indication. We will aim to provide more details of our TAVR clinical plans in the coming months. We're also very well positioned at vascular and structural heart market with our strong momentum in LAAC and potential per share taking in TAVR via both ACURATE and Lotus. We're also raising our expected '17 structural heart revenue guidance from $250 million to approximately $275 million to reflect the revenue impact from the Symetis acquisition, which closed in May. Shifting to Rhythm Management. Global CRM sales grew 2%, which outpaced the challenging worldwide market growth of the industry. Our focus on Rhythm Management profitability has really paid off, resulting in extremely strong adjusted operating margin of 20.9%, which is up 720 basis points year over year, which Dan will detail in a few minutes. As for product trends, brady sales grew mid single digits, and we continue to gain share. However, our growth did slow a bit from prior quarters due to the anniversary of our ACCOLADE MRI brady platform as well as the competitor's launch. We also saw very strong growth globally in EMBLEM S ICD, our quad X4 CRT P and encouraging initial launch feedback of our new RESONATE platform in Europe as well as a slight uptick in CRT D replacement cycle sales, consistent with our replacement curve models. We have submitted clinical data from our ENABLE MRI study to FDA and continue to expect to launch our transvenous MRI compatible high voltage system in the U.S. by year end. Turning to EP. We grew sales 13% in the quarter, led by improved uptake of our new RHYTHMIA HDx platform. We continue to roll out the HDx platform in Europe and now in the U.S. and Japan. We look forward to launching our IntellaNav MiFi open irrigated catheter   therapeutic catheter   wow, IntellaNav MiFi open irrigated therapeutic catheter in the EU and U.S. in third quarter as well as beginning a limited market evaluation of our DirectSense technology in the EU as enabled by our new software upgrade for RHYTHMIA. So to wrap up, Boston Scientific's portfolio strategy, our globalization efforts and execution of our global teams continues to work, and we continue to deliver strong and differentiated results. We believe we are poised for an exciting second half of '17 and that we are well positioned to continue our performance track record in 2018 and beyond. I really want to thank our employees again for their winning spirit and strong commitment to the company in advancing science for life. Dan will now provide a detailed review of our financials.     Thanks, Mike. Second quarter consolidated reported revenue of $2,257,000,000 represents 6% growth on both a reported and organic basis, and 7% on an operational basis, which excludes the impact of changes in foreign currency. This strong top line also reflects a $23 million headwind from foreign exchange, which is $12 million or approximately 55 basis points less compared to a $35 million headwind expected at the time of guidance. The contribution from the recent acquisitions was approximately 120 basis points, which was higher than our guidance of 70 basis points as a result of the strong performance of the pathology business acquired with the EndoChoice deal and sales from the recently closed Symetis acquisition that was not included in the guidance. After adjusting for the performance of the acquisitions, we still exceeded our 5% to 6% operational guidance range on slightly stronger results from the core businesses. We delivered Q2 adjusted earnings per share of $0.32, representing 18% year over year growth and at the high end of our guidance range of $0.30 to $0.32. I'll walk through the details of the results and guidance in a moment, but we're pleased to have exceeded the midpoint of our guidance range and, as a result, are increasing our full year adjusted earnings per share guidance to $1.23 to $1.27 range. Adjusted gross margin for the second quarter was 72.8% compared to 70.7% in Q2 of last year and includes a year over year negative 50 basis point impact from foreign exchange. Adjusted gross margin for the quarter represents a 210 basis point increase over prior year and was at the high end of our guidance range due to favorable product mix in the quarter, particularly from the strength in WATCHMAN and men's health franchises. We continue to expect our full year gross margin to be in the range of 72% to 72.5%, which now assumes a negative FX impact of 100 basis points for the year, a slight increase from the full year 2017 outlook we gave in April. Adjusted SGA expenses were $801 million or 35.5% of sales in Q2 2017, down 40 basis points year over year and at the midpoint of our guidance range of 35% to 36%. We're delivering on our SGA improvement initiatives outlined in detail at our recent Investor Day, such as the optimization and expansion of our global shared services and global indirect sourcing leverage. We continue to target full year 2017 adjusted SGA in a range of 35% to 36% of sales, which, at the midpoint, would represent a decrease of 60 basis points versus the full year 2016. Adjusted research and development expenses were $239 million in the second quarter or 10.6% of sales, which is roughly flat year over year. We continue to expect full year adjusted RD to be in a range of 10% to 11% and continue to target a rate of less than 10% by 2020, driven by geographic mix, greater efficiencies and leverage. Royalty expense was 0.8% of sales in Q2, which is similar to the prior year, and we expect our royalty rate to remain approximately 1% of sales for 2017. As a result, Q2 2017 adjusted operating margin of 26% increased 260 basis points year over year and was at the midpoint of our guidance range of 25.5% to 26.5%. The improvement over prior year was largely driven by strong operational improvements in our Rhythm Management segment operating margin results. The Rhythm Management team delivered an adjusted operating margin of 20.9% for Q2 as the team continues to make strong progress on gross margin, focus on expense control and leverage the improved top line performance of the global business. As you would expect, in any given quarter, you may see some variation in adjusted segment operating margin, but we now expect the full year 2017 Rhythm Management adjusted operating margin to be approximately 19% to 20%, which is an increase over our prior year expectations of 18% to 19%. The Cardiovascular and MedSurg segments also realized year over year improvements in adjusted operating margin of 40 basis points and 110 basis points, respectively, all while continuing to invest in commercial capabilities for key upcoming launches. Now I'll move on to interest and other expense. Interest expense for the quarter was $58 million, roughly flat to Q2 of last year. Our average interest expense rate was 3.9% in Q2 this year compared to 4% in Q2 last year. Adjusted other expense was $14 million in the second quarter and includes $6 million in equity method dilution from our portfolio of venture investments. We believe this is representative of a go forward run rate and annualizes to approximately $25 million per year. We still expect the full year below the line expense, which is comprised of interest expense, dilution from our venture investment portfolio and costs associated with our FX hedging program, to be approximately $300 million in both 2017 and 2018. Of note, this excludes an impairment of certain of our investments of $53 million recorded in the quarter. As we mentioned at our Investor Day, we've grown our portfolio of venture investments to over 30 companies. And as you'd expect, we may see impairments from time to time, but we continue to be very excited about the portfolio. Our tax rate for the second quarter was negative 16.3% on a reported basis and 13.9% on an adjusted basis, at the high end of our guidance range of 13% to 14%. We continue to expect full year adjusted tax rate to be in the range of 12.5% to 13%. Finally, Q2 2017 adjusted earnings per share of $0.32 includes approximately $0.02 of unfavorable foreign exchange, as we expected, and represents 18% year over year growth or 24% growth excluding the impact of foreign exchange. On a reported GAAP basis, which includes net charges and amortization expense totaling $298 million after tax, Q2 2017 EPS was $0.11. This is below our guidance range of $0.18 to $0.21, primarily due to litigation related charges of $205 million associated with our mesh litigation. Our total legal reserve, of which mesh is included, was $1,779,000,000 as of June 30, 2017. During the quarter, as we continued working through settlement discussions and the related claims processing related to our mesh litigation, more of the potential settlement claims were verified than previously expected. As a reminder, to determine our reserve, we continually assess the volume of known claims, the estimated cost to resolve each claim, an estimate of future claims and the cost to defend each claim in order to calculate the required reserve and make any necessary adjustments. We've entered into or are in the final stages of entering into master settlement agreements in principle with certain plaintiffs counsel to resolve an aggregate of approximately 38,000 of our approximately 48,000 known claims, which represents nearly 80% of those claims. We remain committed to reducing the risk in our balance sheet and continue to target a resolution of the majority of our remaining mesh claims in 2018. Adjusted free cash flow for the quarter was $409 million compared to $464 million in Q2 last year. In the quarter, we used cash primarily to fund the previously agreed upon legal settlements as well as the Symetis acquisition. As of June 30, 2017, we had cash on hand of $195 million. We continue to expect full year adjusted free cash flow to be $1,750,000,000, representing 9% growth in the year, and expect the primary use of the cash generated in 2017 and into 2018 will be to fund mesh legal settlements and the IRS stipulation of settled issues once finalized. Capital expenditures for the second quarter 2017 totaled $68 million. We continue to expect capital expenditures for the full year to be approximately $300 million. We ended Q2 with 1,391,000,000 fully diluted weighted average shares outstanding, and we expect a fully diluted weighted average share count of approximately 1,394,000,000 for Q3 and 1,393,000,000 for the full year 2017. Now I'll walk through guidance for Q3 and the full year 2017. For the full year, we now expect consolidated revenue to be in a range of $8,890,000,000 to $8,990,000,000, which represents year over year growth of approximately 7% on an operational basis within a range of 6% to 8% growth. This guidance includes an approximate 120 basis point contribution from EndoChoice and Symetis and represents 6% to 7% growth on a reported basis. We now expect foreign exchange to be a headwind of approximately $30 million for the full year 2017. As I mentioned earlier, we now expect full year 2017 adjusted earnings per share to be in a range of $1.23 to $1.27, representing 11% to 14% adjusted earnings per share growth, and continue to assume the full year negative impact of FX will be approximately $0.08. On a GAAP basis, we expect EPS to be in a range of $0.70 to $0.74. Now turning to Q3 2017. We expect consolidated revenue to be in a range of $2,180,000,000 to $2,210,000,000. This represents year over year growth in a range of 5% to 6% operationally, including the approximate 140 basis point contribution from acquisitions. We expect the foreign exchange impact on Q3 revenue to be a $20 million headwind. For the third quarter, adjusted earnings per share is expected to be in a range of $0.29 to $0.31 per share, representing 9% to 16% adjusted earnings growth. GAAP earnings per share for the third quarter is expected to be in a range of $0.16 to $0.18 per share. Please check our Investor Relations website for Q2 2017 financial and operational highlights, which outlines Q2 results as well as Q3 and full year 2017 guidance, including PL line item guidance. So with that, I'll turn it back to Susie, who will moderate the QA.     Thanks, Dan. Tanya, let's open it up to questions for the next 30 minutes or so. (Operator Instructions) Tanya, please go ahead. I did want to make sure I understood, Dan, the guidance for the year and your thoughts on the third quarter. It looked to us like, with the guidance update, that you're widening the organic sales growth range for the year, from what had been 5.3% to 6.3%, to 4.8% to 6.8%. So one, do we have that right So one, do we have that right that, actually, the range of what we call organic growth backing out EndoChoice and Symetis and currency widened? And then second, how do you view the third quarter comp relative to the comp you had this quarter? Because obviously, we all thought this was a pretty tough comp quarter for you guys, and you put up a very strong performance. Third quarter looks like another very tough comp for you guys. Just put it in some context how you view the year-over-year comparison. Sure, Mike. I'll start, and then Mike can add in any comments he wants as well. So the -- relative to the guidance, I wouldn't overthink the range relative to the full year. So if you look at the range we have, the way we look at it is 7% is what we think is the likely outcome, and we increased the top end to 8%. So as you look at it, we could have thrown 0.5 in there and gone 6.5% to 7.5%. We chose to say 7% is the likely outcome and just ranged it 100 basis points on your side. So I wouldn't overthink the ends of that range. Specific to comps for Q3, it's a 9% organic comp. It was 10% in Q2, and it's a 9% comp in Q3. So feel like, again, off of what are pretty heavy comps from last year, the revenue growth range of 5% to 6% for Q3 is still pretty strong. Okay. And then can you just spend a little more time on the men's health business? Because when you made that acquisition, we didn't view it as being a growth-accretive acquisition. It's turned out to be one. It had a very strong quarter again this quarter and exceeded our expectations. Can you just talk a little bit about what's going on there? Sure. Mike, the Uro business is really performing very high level for many quarters -- a number of quarters in a row now, a 10% revenue growth again in the second quarter. And it's really across the board. The stone business is doing extremely well. And the catalyst for the stone business is our LithoVue disposable scope. That's very disruptive, and we see a lot of tailwinds given some of the comments in the script regarding FDA requirements that are pretty nonreasonable scopes as well as the health care economics that hospitals are starting to see in terms of the cost savings of using LithoVue. And LithoVue is enabling us to pull through greater stone share. And then you move on to the other businesses. The men's health business is doing particularly well, but really exceeding our expectations in the U.S. and globally, and that's a very strong gross margin product for us. The BPH business is doing okay. Another big catalyst for the Uro business is just global expansion. Our emerging market growth is extremely, extremely strong. And we're investing in physician training in men's health as well as adding commercial reps. So essentially having that full portfolio together is driving margin synergies on the bottom line as well as incremental revenue synergies. Just, Dan, maybe a quick clarification and 2 quick product questions. Just in terms of the back half of your guidance, is it a good way to think about it? Basically, you're kind of saying back half is sort of stable on a momentum basis. There's no sort of underlying changes in sort of most of the business lines. It's just the comp is harder, business is pretty stable. Is that a good way to think about the second half? I think that's fair, and then we're adding in Symetis, right? So we didn't have Symetis in the guidance as of last quarter, so we're adding that in. We've obviously updated the structural heart guidance, but I think that's a fair way to look at it, yes, David. Okay. And then -- sorry. And to add to that, so that is the right -- good summary. And then particularly, in Q3, we got very tough DES comp. So we have a 10% comp overall for the company, and our highest DES comp is in the third quarter from '16, which is 14%. Okay, very helpful, Dan and Mike. So 2 quick product questions. The first is just the EP business was the other business other than urology that looked like it got better on a momentum basis. Can you just talk about the trends in EP? And then just the early Symetis feedback, obviously, taking the smaller business on your broader distribution channel, some sense of how that's trending here even though I know it's early days. Yes. So we are committed to this EP business. And we continue to -- I hate to use the word slowly, but we are improving the platform in the product portfolio globally each quarter. And this new launch of this RHYTHMIA HDx platform has gone extremely well in Europe, and we're starting to roll that out a bit more now in Japan and the U.S. So it's giving physicians more confidence in the differentiation of RHYTHMIA. And we'll be embarking on a nice cadence of therapeutic catheter launches, ideally, in the second half in Europe with our IntellaNav MiFi OI launch, and that will be followed in '18 with that same therapeutic catheter launch in the U.S. So you'll start to see more impactful therapeutic catheter launch cadence coming. And Dr. Stein, is there any comments you'd like to make? The only thing I'd add, Dave, is the IntellaNav MiFi OI catheter in combination with RHYTHMIA HDx then becomes the foundational platform for our DirectSense technology, which we really do see as being revolutionary in enabling physicians to better assess tissue contact, the type of tissue catheters in contact with and then also becomes the foundation for our Force Sensing technology as well. Thanks, Ken, Dr. Stein. On the Symetis, we're really pleased. It's early days. We're just under 2 months. The integration has gone -- going extremely well. The leadership team is in place and solidified there. We're focused on expanding supply of the capability ramping the manufacturing. And importantly, we're training all of our TAVR commercial team, clinical and commercial on the ACURATE platform. And so the great news is when our Lotus platform gets back in the market by year-end, we'll have a clinical team and a sales force that can sell both platforms. So we're pleased with that, we upped our structural heart guidance a bit to $275 million to reflect the impact of Symetis. I was hoping to just start off with a question back from the Investor Day, just on the TAVR franchise and intermediate and low-risk time lines. So the strategy behind waiting until 2019, I was just hoping you could just recap that and help us think about the start of those trials and again, the strategy behind waiting until 2019. Thanks, Josh. This is Ian Meredith here. So I'm pleased to take your question. Obviously, the first and highest priority is to have Lotus EDGE approved in the U.S. for very extreme and high-risk patients. And we'll follow that with establishing a Lotus EDGE bicuspid valve registry. And then the immediate priority thereafter is high and extreme-risk ACURATE approval in the U.S. and Japan. And of course, our priorities -- hot on the tail of those immediate priorities would be intermediate and low-risk approval in U.S., Japan for both ACURATE, Symetis -- the ACURATE neo/AS platform and, indeed, Lotus EDGE. So with those priorities structured that way, the highest priority is obviously to establish extreme and high-risk approval for both valves as expeditiously and as timely as can be achieved. And then the low risk, of course, will be to follow the intermediate risk, as one would expect. It is likely that those trials would have to be randomized. And just on a follow-up, the Endoscopy business, you made some comments, Mike, in your prepared remarks, but I was just hoping if there's anything else. The sequential growth for that business was phenomenal. Just one of the line items that we were a little bit concerned about heading into the quarter, but 6%, 7% sequential growth. Were there any one-timers there? Is this just still pure strength on SpyGlass adoption, utilization? And how sustainable is that type of sequential growth trend? That business performs for us each quarter, 12% operational, 7% organic when you back out the acquisition that we made. And I think what's unique about this business is their core products continue to grow nicely, and they're expanding into new categories. The SpyGlass digital platform has really been a breakthrough for the company. And they continue to focus on additional enhancements to kind of extend the lead there. That pulls through some of the core portfolio. The EndoChoice acquisition has moved us into some new spaces where there's a lot of synergies in the pathology market. And so -- and then lastly, it's a very global company -- this business for us. Over half of the sales are outside the U.S., and there's very strong growth there in emerging markets. So we expect that Endo business to continue to put up strong above-market growth. Can we pause for a minute on your third quarter guidance? By our calculation, it looks like it's up 3.5% to 4.5%, 3.6% to 4.6% organic. Is that the right way to look at it? And if so, that's somewhat in the lower side than I would have expected. Am I looking at this right? Joanne, this is Dan. No, the way I would look at it is the guidance for Q3 is 5% to 6%, right, operational growth. The contribution from the acquisitions of EndoChoice and Symetis is 140 basis points. So if you take that off, you get to an organic growth rate, again, in the range of what you're saying. Some of the challenges there in terms of the sequential growth from Q2 to Q3, you look at CRM. We anniversary some of the MRI-safe brady technologies in the U.S. We love the growth we've had in urology, but at 18% and 10% and some very high comps there, with anniversary-ing some share gains from a competitor exit, and then Mike mentioned the DES comps that we have. So the organic piece is a little bit lower than Q2, but still at that 5% to 6% off of that 9% comp from last year, and then another 10% comp in Q4 feel like that still stacks up pretty well compared to peers. Yes, I'll just add, a bit of a cheerleader here, but I think a 6% to 8% full year guidance, midpoint of 7%, nice -- pretty nicely above the peer group against 9% or 10% organic growth comp for the year. So I think if we can grow the company faster than the peer group facing to that type of comparison, that's pretty strong. And then when we look forward to '18 and then as we detailed at Investor Day, the comps will be slightly easier in '18 than they were this year. And then we're, as I mentioned before, really excited about this $13 billion of new markets that we're entering into when you look at that Investor Day presentation '18 through '20. So I think it's a pretty strong performance for the team delivering above market against the 10% comp. That was good to me. As a follow-up question, WATCHMAN is really doing quite well. You raised your structural heart guidance. How do we think about the momentum in that franchise? And can you remind us about the timing of next-generation products, how they start coming into the market to help you out? Sure. WATCHMAN is doing great. We -- I think the important thing is just the clinical success that, that platform has seen. The actual real implant success rates actually are exceeding the safety rates seen in some of the clinical trials. So the performance, most importantly in the safety and efficacy, as detailed at HRS and EuroPCR clinical trials that Dr. Stein can highlight a bit more if you're interested, are very good. So you're building physician confidence with the platform. We obviously took up our structural heart revenue guidance to $275 million, which is the big part of that is WATCHMAN obviously, given Lotus recall. And a big part of our efforts beyond the safety and great outcomes is on market development. So we are building quite a few different swim lanes of digital capabilities, therapeutic reps to drive increased awareness, leveraging the broader commercial teams of our CRM, EP and IC teams to drive awareness and to assist the WATCHMAN sales team. And then we're looking at expanding globally. We're enhancing our contribution of WATCHMAN in China, and we're excited about bringing WATCHMAN to the Japanese market in mid-'19. On the next-generation WATCHMAN product, likely to have EU approval in mid-'18 for the WATCHMAN FLX platform. Dr. Stein, any other comments on WATCHMAN in general? Again, just to say, we're pleased, as you say, with the momentum, see it continuing as we continue to train, bring new operators, new centers online. In terms of the clinical trial cadence, as Mike said, expecting the enhanced FLX to get CE Mark in mid-'18 and to begin enrolling in our U.S. approval trial at that point, which would put us on track to get estimated U.S. approval of roughly the same time as our competitors get approval on their first-generation devices. Likewise, just to reiterate, as Mike said, completed enrollment to Japan of SALUTE, which is the trial that will get us approval in Japan. And although we're in the early stages, pleased at this point with the cadence of our ASAP 2 trial, which is an indication expansion trial that will get us at FDA labeling for the oral anticoagulation contraindicated population. Two product-related questions, starting with drug-eluting stents. I think I heard you say, Mike, that it was about 1% growth on a global basis in Q2. And SYNERGY has been a great product for you guys but that lapping. So I'm curious to hear your thoughts and Dr. Meredith's thoughts on kind of what's next, how we should think about growth going forward? And we didn't hear a lot about your internal bioabsorbable program at the Analyst Day. But Dr. Meredith, I'm curious to hear how you're thinking about the future of this franchise from a technology standpoint. And I have one follow-up. Sure. I'll make a few comments, and then Dr. Meredith can add. Our DES business really pays a lot of the bills for our investments in structural heart. So the fact that we can continue to grow that business despite a double-digit comp is a nice accomplishment by the global team there. So we do anticipate that SYNERGY will continue to be the market-leading stent, that it will grow slightly above market, and it will drive the contribution that we needed to so we can fuel all our WATCHMAN, TAVR and eventual Mitral programs. So that's a really important part of our portfolio. And we don't see a really -- over our LRP program, we don't see a new stent offering from a competitor that will threaten the safety, clinical efficacy of SYNERGY. So I think we're in a good position strategically. In terms of next generation, the bulk of our investment, as Kevin talked about at the Investor Day meeting, is in complex coronary as well as structural heart. So that's the primary investment area with our cardiology business. And maybe Dr. Meredith can make some comments on fully resorbable space, if you'd like. Thanks, Mike. I think we're all aware of the pertinent data that is now being published to show the less-than-stellar performance of first-generation bioabsorbable stents. And these scaffolds been associated with a higher risk of stent thrombosis at 1 year that led to a warning note in Europe, of course. This has meant that there's some skepticism towards this technology currently, and it certainly means that we don't need to focus primarily on this at this point in time. Obviously, the Renuvia platform has been of straps and is more fracture-resistant. But given the sort of global move away from BRS technologies at the moment, it doesn't make sense to have that as a primary focus. Okay, that's very helpful. And then back to WATCHMAN, one of the comments you made at the Investor Day that I felt was interesting was that you expect over 30,000 implants over the next 14 to 18 months, which is roughly the number of implants since launch. And by our math, that implies about $420 million in revenue assuming about a $14,000 ASP. Is that the right way to think about it? And do you feel that you can get there closer to 14 months at this point? Or are you still keeping that range of 14 to 18 months? Yes, I think on the heels of what we had said at Investor Day, we'd stick with that. And I think the commentary of Dr. Stein and Mike is appropriate that we're really excited about WATCHMAN and the technology and what it has done and what it can do in the future. But we'd stick with that timing over that time frame. Some more TAVR first. Can you give us any more color on where you are with the Lotus fix? Last we heard, I think at PCR, you were implementing manufacturing changes. Is that all done? And maybe some color on the regulatory process as well. And on Symetis, it's an easy -- they have to learn, you're training everybody. Maybe you could talk to us about when the training is going to be done and your thoughts about with this easy-to-learn valves, could we see a fairly rapid Symetis uptake in new European centers? Yes. So on Symetis, it really will never be done because we're going to train our reps around the world. The cadence of Symetis moves from Europe to U.S., Japan and over Asia. So it's really part of our ongoing platform. Now the good news is that all the training programs are in place, and we're building up additional staff and training capabilities to fully train the existing BSC team and the BSC team in the U.S. that's being established to launch Lotus. So that infrastructure is moving along quite well. Xavier and the team in Europe are doing a nice job in building that out. And we are seeing, I would say, slightly above our deal model early days in terms of Symetis uptake. And some of the comments that were made at Investor Day, say, a high-performing valve that's very, very easy to use and has very impressive kind of clinical studies that are in flight, that will be reported out in the scope trials. So Symetis is going well. We're very excited about that, and we're pleased that we doubled down in that market given the size and the differentiation between Lotus and Symetis. On Lotus itself, there's really nothing new to report since the Investor Day meeting. We anticipate EU launch by year-end and U.S. PMA approval in fourth quarter, so we can launch that product ideally end of second quarter in the U.S. And the RD teams and ops teams, supply chain teams doing a really nice job. And we want to lock that down so we can mass-produce Lotus to serve the markets. And essentially, we feel like the fix is identified months ago. And the root cause and all the additional validation and also the engagement with the regulatory bodies in Europe is a bit fluid, and that's where we're working through. But we feel like the time lines that we've laid out give us the proper amount of flexibility to manage any minimal clinical requirements or any regulatory discussions. And just on S-ICD adoption, you highlighted the strong worldwide EMBLEM growth, which is encouraging. Just where are we in the penetration goals that you dreamt of? And do we need the MRI -- I'm sorry, the leadless pacer approval to really further accelerate the growth? Or is there a lot more to go even before you get there? Rick, I'll take that. It's Ken. I think we're even probably a little better than where we thought we would be when we did the deal to acquire Cameron and the S-ICD. In terms of where do we go with penetration, right, the key is at this point, how deeply can we get penetrated into the traditional primary prevention indicated market. And that's why I thought the data that we presented at HRS earlier this year and highlighted at the Investors Day from our post-approval study in the U.S., we now see that 2/3 of the implants of the device in the U.S. are in that traditional primary prevention population. And I think even ahead of getting our modular CRM device that is the leadless pacemaker that communicates with the S-ICD, even ahead of getting that, we see that we can continue to grow that penetration into primary prevention. And then I think the 2 opportunities to further accelerate that are, first of all, getting modular CRM into clinical trials and eventually into the market. There is an opportunity to provide antitachycardia pacing while staying leadless for those patients who need it. And then also our MADITS-ICD trial, which is an indication expansion trial that would potentially bring in a completely new population of primary prevention patients, and that's those patients with mid-range ejection fractions, myocardial infarction and diabetes. And again, that's a population that's roughly equivalent in size to the current primary prevention market to begin with and a population that we feel is uniquely served by the S-ICD. We lost Bob. Can't hear him. Can you hear me okay? We can hear you fine, Matt. Yes, go ahead. Okay, great. So I wanted to ask a question just on the balance sheet and cash flow. You're getting some more visibility on working through some of the settlements. And presumably, that will give you some more confidence and flexibility. Can you talk about, I guess, a, when that could happen and how you might think about doing things differently when you have some more confidence in kind of that cash flow outlook? Thanks, Matt. Yes, I think we hit this pretty well at Investor Day as well that as we start to work through this year, this year is a big year for retiring the historical liabilities in terms of mesh and the IRS settlements. So put a lot of that behind us in '17, still have a tail of that into '18. But once you get into certainly the second half of '18 and absolutely into '19 and '20, you would see a significant increase in the amount of our free cash flow that we'll be able to be put to more strategic uses like returning cash to shareholders and MA. So I don't think there's any change relative to the philosophy of how we would view that over that time frame. We're looking forward to it relative to being able to put more of that cash to use. But the underlying philosophy and the financial discipline and the category leadership strategy that we've had, I think, is alive and well and would serve us well as we move through that time frame. And just a follow-up on kind of a prior question. I appreciate Dr. Stein's comments on opportunities for S-ICD. I was wondering if you could comment on any thoughts you have now with a little bit of time since the announcement of the reopening of the NCD for ICDs and/or the comment period on MRI if you think either of those things could have an impact on the market. Yes, sure, Matt. We -- the fully supported CMS decision to reopen the NCD for ICDs and how we -- let me deal with that before the MRI. And what we gave in terms of our feedback to CMS with this recommendation, they preserve coverage for the currently covered populations and to revise the NCDs so it doesn't limit device choice. And most important, I think to liberalize some of the current restrictions so that it can be consistent with the current guidelines and appropriate use criteria as developed by the societies, ACC, HRS, et cetera. I think with MRI, again, the question in terms of what's going to happen with their NCD really is going to be whether they're going to remove some of the restrictions on performing MRI for patients with legacy devices based on the results of trials like the MagnaSafe Registry. Whether or not they do that, I don't see as having really any substantial impact on the market for devices that are being implanted currently. Can you hear me okay? We can hear you fine, Bob. Great. All right. Sorry about that last one. So Mike, just to start it out, I've heard lots of questions here on answers you provided. So maybe just to be clear, is there any change to any of the time lines that you mentioned at the Analyst Day? Or any change whatsoever to your confidence in the revenue growth outlook as you discussed at the Analyst Day? No. I did screw up earlier on the call. I mentioned that Lotus was going to be approved in the U.S. in fourth quarter this year. That was a miss. I meant to say the PMA filing for U.S. will happen in fourth quarter '17. So I did a nice job of messing that answer up. But other than that one, our outlook financially is unchanged from our Investor Day. We took our sales guidance up for the year upper end by 1 point. And just on that sort of -- so these U.S. time lines are the same as you talked about at the Analyst Day? Yes, time lines for all TAVR -- essentially, time lines for everything haven't changed for the last 45 days. Perfect. Just wanted to clarify. And then, Dan, just one quick one for you on currency. I was wondering if you could just talk about the impact of currency on this year and next. Maybe just help us understand from where rates are right now, what the impact of hedging is versus just the impact of FX translation, just so we get a little bit of a better sense of the moving pieces and what's in your guidance. Sure. Let me start with revenue on that, Bob. So as we've gone through the year, the amount of headwind from FX on the top line has dissipated, right? We started off thinking about 125. It's gone to 85. Now for our most recent guidance, it's 30. And actually, in Q4, it flipped to a tailwind for us, right? So the -- and that's obviously the market basket of rates that have changed over that time frame, primarily the euro strengthening against the dollar, the pound a little bit the same, and then most other currencies seeing dollar strength and the yen being somewhat flat during that time frame. So pretty clear on that. We haven't given revenue impact guidance for 2018. We'll obviously do that as the time draws near to giving that guidance. In terms of gross margin, it's actually been a little bit of a different story. It was kind of 50 basis points full year, and the February guidance went to 90, and now it's 100, so roughly unchanged from the April guidance. And that's just simply a reflection of the hedging contracts we have when they were entered into and then the expiration of those, so -- and which currencies are moving. So you don't -- the reason that the top line has gotten better through the year, but we still have -- we'll still see $0.08 at the bottom line as we're largely hedged for the year. I mean, the majority of that top line benefit has been from the euro, and we're largely hedged against the euro for '17, so you don't get a lot of the drop-through, which is the benefit of a hedging program. You don't want the significant swings. So that's kind of the relationship in '17 of top line and bottom line. And we were pretty clear, I think, at Investor Day that we see about a $0.05 of negative FX with rates where they are today in 2018. Just a couple of follow-ups on some of the topics that you've covered. One, on the CRM share recapture, the growth in that business, any color you could provide just on the drivers of that? Obviously, MRI safe and pacers and some of the newly launched just a year or so ago in high power. But any other competitive drivers you see or advantages you're enjoying would be helpful. And I had one follow-up on WATCHMAN. Yes. So overall, really pleased, not only particularly pleased with the margin improvement that Joe Fitzgerald's team delivered, impressive in a market that's challenging in terms of overall growth profile. What's important for us in CRM is we're continuing to grow above market. Our brady results were nicely above market despite anniversary-ing our launch and a competitor's recent launch. So we expect some challenges there with some of the comps, but we continue to grow above market, which is kind of the trend for the company. And then in defib, which is really important, I think an encouraging trend there despite kind of flat overall growth, with the growth outside the U.S. where we've launched the RESONATE platform. So in Europe in particular, we're seeing some lightness in volume. But the team's done a nice job of growing that business off the RESONATE launch, and that will be the launch that will happen in the U.S. more fully once we have MRI approved by year-end. So in '18, we look forward to having global defib RESONATE platform with the multi-point pacing as well as MRI capability in HeartLogic as well as the Longevity benefit. So we think we have a lot of differentiation with that. And then as Dr. Stein commented, our S-ICD platform really differentiates Boston Scientific. It comes with nice gross margins, and we continue to see improved utilization of that platform. So I think the product positioning is quite strong, and we hope to see some of the benefits of the replacement cycle. Now that being said, of all of our markets, it's likely the most challenged in terms of its overall growth rate kind of in the low single-digit growth rate range. Sure. Very helpful color. And then on maybe one of your more rapidly expanding markets on WATCHMAN. If you could talk a little bit about the way you're seeing sort of new centers coming up to speed in the U.S., the pace of that growth, maybe also the degree to which other product lines are getting pulled into these conversations with your customers, either Afib or CRM or otherwise, that kind of color would be very helpful. Yes. Thank you, Matt. WATCHMAN, as we said, we're very pleased with its uptake, but we're definitely not satisfied because we want -- we expect a lot more. Every point of utilization, as we highlighted at Investor Day, is another $250 million market opportunity. So our focus besides getting strong clinical results and training is increasing utilization, and that's where most of our efforts are on. We have a large implanter base of approximately 350, 375. We're focused on training more doctors, more physicians at those sites and really trying to find any friction points in those sites to improve utilization, and that's what the teams are working through. And you see a wide, quite frankly, a wide range of utilization across sites and centers. And our focus is on improving that scale across the board. And we have a nice head start competitively, as you know. I won't comment too much more on pull-through. Obviously, when you have a nice platform like that as well as a leading drug-eluting stent, I've commented on the RESONATE platform for CRM, our overall portfolio in PI, which actually hasn't been discussed today, our overall portfolio in PI, Interventional Cardiology and Rhythm is quite strong. And then with our structural heart emphasis, there is some, occasionally, some bundling that goes across, but I would say a lot less bundling than what's discussed with analysts, quite frankly. With that, we'd like to conclude the call. Thank you for joining us today. We appreciate your interest in Boston Scientific. Before you disconnect, Tanya will give you all the pertinent details for the replay. Thank you.\",\n          \"    Good morning.

After the company's prepared remarks, we will open the session to questions. I will now turn the call over to Bob Wells.     Thanks, Jessie. Good morning, everyone. Before summarizing our results for the quarter, I'd like to remind you that our annual financial community presentation is coming up on June 5 here in Cleveland, Ohio. Please contact me or Jim Jaye to receive the registration link to this event. It's a great opportunity for you to meet and hear from our business unit management team, and we hope to see you all there. Moving on to our results for the first quarter. All comparisons in my remarks are to the first quarter of fiscal 2018, unless otherwise stated. Consolidated sales in the first quarter of 2019 increased $75.9 million, or 1.9%, to $4.04 billion. Consolidated gross profit dollars in the quarter increased $48.2 million, or 2.9%, to $1.74 billion. Consolidated gross margin in the first quarter increased to 42.9% from 42.5% in the same period last year. Excluding impacts from purchase accounting, adjusted consolidated gross margin in the quarter was flat year over year at 43%. Selling, general and administrative expense increased $29.5 million, or 2.4%, to $1.24 billion in the first quarter, and also increased as a percent of sales to 30.8% from 30.6% in the same quarter last year. Interest expense for the quarter was essentially flat at $91 million. Consolidated profit before tax in the first quarter decreased $4.7 million or, 1.6%, to $298.9 million. The first quarter of 2019 included nonoperating expenses of $32.4 million, primarily related to a pension plan settlement, as described in our press release and included in our previous guidance. Excluding acquisition related costs and nonoperating expenses, our effective tax rate on adjusted income for the quarter was 19.3%. Diluted net income per common share for the first quarter 2019 was flat compared to last year at $2.62 per share. Earnings per share in the first quarter of 2019 includes nonoperating expenses of $0.27 per share and acquisition related expenses of $0.71 per share. The $2.62 per share reported in the first quarter of 2018 included $0.95 per share in acquisition related expenses. Excluding these items from both years, adjusted diluted earnings per share increased to $3.60 in the first quarter of 2019 from $3.57 last year. We have summarized the first quarter earnings per share comparison in a Regulation G reconciliation table at the end of our press release. Let me take a few minutes to break down our performance by segment. Sales for The Americas Group in the first quarter increased $74.4 million, or 3.6%, to $2.15 billion. Unfavorable currency translation reduced sales in the quarter by 1.5%. Comparable store sales in the U.S. and Canada increased 3.6% in the quarter. Regionally, in the first quarter, our Southeast Division led all divisions, followed by Eastern, Canada, Southwest and Midwest. Sales were positive in every division in the quarter. First quarter segment profit decreased $6.3 million, or 1.9%, to $331.1 million. Currency translation rate changes decreased segment profit $4.5 million in the quarter. First quarter segment operating margin declined 80 basis points to 15.4% from 16.2% last year. Turning now to the Consumer Brands Group. First quarter sales decreased $1.9 million, or 0.3%, to $654.5 million, including the divestiture of the Guardsman business. Sales from continuing operations, excluding approximately $17 million in Guardsman revenues, increased 2.4% in the quarter. First quarter segment profit increased $13.7 million, or 18.5%, to $87.9 million. Purchase accounting costs decreased segment profit by $22.9 million compared to $31.8 million in the first quarter 2018. First quarter segment operating margin increased to 13.4% from 11.3% last year. Excluding the purchase accounting expenses in both quarters, adjusted segment operating margin increased to 16.9% in the first quarter 2019 from 16.2% in the first quarter last year. For our Performance Coatings Group, first quarter sales increased $3 million, or 0.3%, to $1.23 billion. Currency translation rate changes reduced first quarter sales by 3.9%. First quarter segment profit increased $7.9 million, or 8.7%, to $98.7 million. Unfavorable currency translation reduced segment profit $3.5 million in the quarter, and purchase accounting expense decreased segment profit by $54.1 million compared to $57.5 million in the first quarter 2018. First quarter performance group segment operating margin increased to 8% from 7.4% last year. Excluding the purchase accounting expense in both quarters, segment operating margin increased to 12.4% in the first quarter 2019 compared to 12.1% in the first quarter last year. That concludes our review of operating results for the first quarter, so let me turn the call over to John Morikis, who will make some general comments on the first quarter and provide our outlook for second quarter and full year 2019. John?     Thank you. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us. I'd like to make just a few additional comments on our first quarter before moving onto our outlook. First quarter volumes were a bit lighter than anticipated across all 3 segments, driving consolidated results to the lower end of our expectations range. We commented in our press release issued this morning that the North American architectural painting season got off to a slow start compared to last year, but it's important to keep this in perspective. It is traditionally the smallest revenue quarter of the year, and it is volatile year to year, so it's often not very representative of underlying demand trends. Robust feedback from our professional painting contractor customers has long been our most reliable indicator of North American architectural paint demand. These customers almost universally remain optimistic about 2019 and continue to report unseasonably high project backlogs and a very healthy pipeline of new projects. This consistent feedback underpins our confidence in our full year outlook in spite of the slow start to the season. Our sales results in the quarter highlighted the geographic variability in demand we have seen since midyear last year. Volume growth in North America ranged from stable to strong, with a few exceptions, while the softness in Asia and Europe was fairly broad based but also with a few noteworthy exceptions. Pricing was favorable across all of our businesses in the quarter, while the impact of currency translation on all 3 segments was a bit more of a headwind than expected. While we're not satisfied with our top line performance, consolidated gross margin on an adjusted basis improved 60 basis points sequentially and was flat year over year at 43%. This is encouraging given our expectation that the rate of raw material inflation year over year will be highest in first quarter. We expect to see more gross margin improvement over the balance of the year as volumes pick up, the rate of raw material inflation moderates, and we continue to benefit from pricing actions announced over the past year. SGA in the quarter came in largely as expected, and we'll continue to maintain appropriate discipline on spending as the year unfolds. Within The Americas Group, sales increased 3.6% against the prior year comparison of 6.6%. Sales volume growth in our North America stores fell short of our expectations. Sales to Protective  Marine and residential repaint contractors were our strongest customer segments in the quarter, both up high single digits over last year. All other customer segments were positive. Our business in Latin America went from positive double digit growth last year to a high single digit decline this year due to high teens unfavorable currency translation. Segment profit dollars and margins for the group were negatively impacted by lower than anticipated volume, which, in North America, was likely the result of projects being postponed. During the quarter, we opened 15 net new stores, finishing the quarter with 4,711 stores in operation compared to 4,624 last year. Our plan calls for this team to add approximately 90 to 100 net new stores in the Americas by the end of this year. In the Consumer segment, first quarter sales were positive in North America even if we include the negative impact of the Guardsman divestiture. Demand was considerably softer in nondomestic regions during the quarter, most notably Asia Pacific. We made pretty good progress on improving the profitability of this business as segment margin, excluding purchase accounting impacts, increased both sequentially and year over year. This is the highest quarterly operating margin reported by this segment since the acquisition of Valspar. We are successfully executing our strategy in this business, and we are well positioned with our retail partners heading into the spring paint selling season. Performance Coatings Group's sales in the quarter grew modestly against a challenging prior year comparison of 9.8% on a pro forma basis. Revenue and volume growth in packaging and coil was offset by flat to down sales results in the segment's other businesses. Geographically, sales increased in North America, but these gains were offset by declines in Asia Pacific and Europe, where sales were down high single and mid single digits, respectively. We continue to see some benefit from our pricing actions across these businesses and regions as adjusted segment margin improved by 30 basis points year over year to 12.4%. EBITDA in the quarter was $533 million, or $575 million on an adjusted basis to exclude the pension plan settlement expense and acquisition related costs. Working capital was a higher use of cash in the quarter as we built additional inventory through our fourth and first quarters to ensure our ability to respond to anticipated strong seasonal order volumes in our stores and retail customers. At the end of the quarter, we had $94 million of cash on hand that will be utilized to fund operations and reduce debt. The balance sheet reflects total debt of approximately $9.8 billion. We intend to reduce our net debt by approximately $600 million during the year, which will result in a net debt to EBITDA ratio below 3:1 by the end of 2019. After prioritizing debt reduction over other uses of cash during the past 2 years, we are resuming our historical capital allocation philosophy in 2019. We returned approximately $410 million to shareholders during the quarter, including $105 million in cash dividends and $305 million to purchase 750,000 shares of common stock. During the quarter, we increased our quarterly dividend by 31% to $1.13 per share. At quarter end, our share repurchase authorization stood at 9.38 million shares. Capital expenditures were $51 million in the quarter, depreciation was $65 million, and amortization was $79 million. As we move into the second quarter 2019, we expect consolidated net sales to increase 2% to 5% compared to the second quarter of 2018, with The Americas Group at or above the high end of that range. As a reminder, second quarter revenue comparisons to 2018 in The Americas Group and the Performance Coatings Group are the most challenging of the year. And Consumer Brands Group faces comparisons to early load in volume from the Lowe's program and the divested Guardsman business. Our full year 2019 revenue guidance remains unchanged, with net sales increasing 4% to 7% compared to full year 2018. On an earnings per share basis, we believe the most meaningful way to provide guidance is to exclude Valspar acquisition related costs and nonoperating items. On this basis, and given our sales outlook, we are confirming our adjusted 2019 full year diluted net income per common share to be in the range of $20.40 to $21.40 per share, an increase of approximately 13% at the midpoint compared to the $18.53 reported last year on a comparable basis. We've included a Regulation G reconciliation table with this morning's press release to better illustrate all the moving parts. We expect our 2019 effective tax rate to be in the low 20% range. A few additional data points for the full year may be helpful for modeling purposes. These data points have not changed from the guidance we provided in January. We expect raw material inflation for full year 2019 will be in the low single digits compared to 2018. The rate of year over year inflation, assuming stable petrochemical feedstocks and no supply disruptions, should diminish from the level we saw in the first quarter as we progress through the year. We expect incremental synergies of approximately $70 million to $80 million in 2019, and a total annual run rate of approximately $415 million at year end. We expect full year capital expenditures to be approximately $320 million, depreciation to be about $257 million and amortization to be about $315 million. With that, I'd like to thank you for joining us this morning, and we'll be happy to take your questions. As it relates to your intermediate-term outlook for U.S. housing, can you just hit on the key ongoing trends by subregion? Just any updated views on rates, affordability, single versus multifamily? And just any preliminary views on salts would be greatly appreciated. Yes, Chris. And we're going to sound a little like a broken record on this subject, because we continue to believe that the sharp declines in starts year-to-date, particularly in single family, is not a reflection of a decline in demand. And in fact, March new home sales were pretty strong. So that kind of underpins our view that the rate of new home construction is unsustainably low at the current rate given continued strength in household formation. Household formations are going to continue in the range of, call it, 1.2 million to 1.3 million annually for the next 5-plus years. And historically, if you look at the rate of new home starts, they've run at approximately -- a rate of approximately 1.3x the rate of household formations. And that's just to account for housing units that are taken out of stock over time either by natural disaster or demolition, whatever the case maybe. But over the past 4 years, housing starts have run roughly in line with household formations. And as a result, what we've seen is inhabitable vacancies have largely been absorbed, and single-family rental stock is being converted to owner-occupied stock. And we don't think that, that is going to be able to sustain demand for housing long term. So it's a broader answer to a little more granular question that you asked, but we think the challenge for builders continues to be building affordable, entry-level units given high land cost -- high land development cost, labor cost, et cetera. And while we think that the starts in the first quarter were abnormally low, we expect to see a pickup in starts as we go through the year. We agree with the outlook that homebuilding should be up over 2018 and '19. It's likely going to be up modestly, low single digits. In terms of any regional variation, the Southeast continues to be very strong. Southwest has had some challenges but should pick up as well, and that's where you're going to see most of the activity. Got it. And just a quick follow-up. Just within kind of the ongoing multiyear integration of Performance Coatings, it seems like you guys are back on the track on the pricing fronts. Can you just comment on your just your updated long-term views by subsegment, with just an emphasis on general industrial packaging and wood? Just what have been the biggest surprises, both positive and negative? Chris, this is Al Mistysyn. I'm going to talk about the consolidated segment, and then I'll let John comment about the individual pieces. But as we saw in our first quarter, nice year-over-year margin improvement. And that's really the teams doing a great job, working with their customers to get the pricing through to offset the persistent raw material inflation that we saw, and also seeing nice synergy realization and controlling their SGA. So we have talked about targeting high-teens to low-20% operating margin, and we feel like we're on that track here in '19, and more to come as the year progresses. Yes. And Chris, the only piece I'd add to that is that this continues to be something that we're very focused on. We believe that as the 2 companies came together, we found ourselves in an inflationary period and felt that it was important to work with our customers through that process of implementing these prices. I don't know if we're going to break down every segment to tell you the ground that we're gaining in each one, but I will tell you that we are gaining ground in each one. And while we've accepted some compression over the elevating raw material basket, we also believe that the solutions that we're bringing our customers and the services that we're providing as part of those solutions are opportunities for us to work with our customers in pushing through those price increases, and we're determined to do just that. Are the raw material trends in the United States different than they are in the offshore markets? And how would you compare raw material price inflation U.S. versus the rest of the world? Jeff, I think there are some differences in certain commodities like titanium dioxide. I don't necessarily believe that the petrochemical side of the basket is vastly different as you look around the world. TiO2 has been stable in the U.S., and I think it's been moving a bit more in Asia Pacific and Europe. The petrochemicals, kind of surprisingly, given the move in crude oil, have been somewhat stable with, as you know, with propylene and ethylene actually trading down year -- trading lower year-over-year. We have not seen much benefit from that in our raw material basket yet, but we expect to as we move through the balance of the year. Great. You said in your press release that your same-store sales growth was 3.6% a quarter in The Americas Group. Like order of magnitude, are prices up 2.5 and volumes up 1 for the first quarter? Yes, Jeff. That sounds about right. We talked about the realization coming out of our year-end call about 2.5. And we might be a little bit better than that, but I think you're directionally correct. Will Nippon's deal for Dulux in Australia change your strategy at all in Australia? No, it shouldn't. Great. And then in the packaging coatings area, are we still seeing penetration from non-BPA, or is that now largely over with? We're having very good success in our non-BPA, our V70 product. In fact, packaging was the exception of all our industrial businesses. It was up globally and it was up in all regions. So we continue to see a nice performance in our packaging business. Just wanted to touch on The Americas Group's margins. In the first quarter, they fell about 80 bps year-over-year. Could you just explain why this was? And how much of it would you say was due to the lack of volume and leverage versus raw material inflation maybe coming in a bit heavier than what you expected. Yes. Truman, as John mentioned in his opening remark, the first quarter in North America is our smallest quarter and most volatile. And it truly is all about the volume. And it was a little lower than anticipated in our North America Paint Stores Group. And to your point, we also saw higher year-over-year raw material inflation in the quarter. So those are driving that margin. But that being said, we continue to invest in 87 net new stores over the past year, with a corresponding increase in sales reps to support those stores. That's a continuation of our consistent long-term approach to North American architectural market. And we have not slowed our cadence down on the store openings just because of the last 2 quarters we've had. And we believe this is going to continue to allow us to grow market share 1.5 to 2x the market. And it's historically allowed us to gain larger share of the market when the cycle turns. So we talked about the price increases, and I feel pretty good about those. And with the price increase and the demand outlook that John talked about in his opening comments, I am confident that our TAG organization is going to expand margins this year. Okay. And to follow up on that, with the raw material inflation you guys -- could you guys just give an update to your prior, I think, low single-digit raw material inflation guidance? And I'm just trying to understand your confidence in this -- in your guidance, considering 2018 kind of caught everybody off guard, especially with your guys comment that 1Q is going to be the high watermark for raw material inflation, considering that oil seems like it's ticked up quite a bit here lately. Yes, Truman. At this point, I think our outlook for first quarter being the peak appears to be at least correct so far. Your point on oil moving, it's certainly moved quite a ways, but propylene and ethylene have not. And propylene, in particular, which is the primary feedstock, still is down year-over-year. It's barely moved off a $0.32 bottom. So those being the primary drivers of the petrochemical side of our basket still look very favorable. I'm not saying they couldn't move with crude oil, but they haven't thus far. Our outlook for low single-digit inflation for full year presume that the highest year-over-year increase, as you said, was in the first quarter. And I think it's safe to assume that the market average price for the broad basket of materials we buy was probably up in the low to mid-single digits in the first quarter. We expect to see that moderate as we go into the second quarter. Not to say second quarter couldn't be inflationary, but it will be lower inflation than we saw in the first. By the time we get in the back half, it should be deflationary. Okay. Okay. And just to follow up real quick, if I'm reading you correctly, with propylene and ethylene still being down year-over-year, are you saying that there might be a chance that your oil-derived resins might be down in the back half of the year? There's a chance. They stepped up sharply midyear last year. And while we're not back to below the level they were prior to June last year, after -- as we annualize that move up in midyear, there's a chance they'll be down year-over-year in the back half. John, in your prepared comments, you referenced strong backlog for the customer level for The Americas Group. Can you give us some more color on that? Which vertical in particular have a stronger backlog? What feedback specifically are customers giving you in current market conditions, especially if interest rates progress lower throughout the quarter? Ghansham, I'd say that we're really excited about the balance of the year because of the feedback that we're getting across all the verticals, all the segments. We obviously have a terrific model in this controlled distribution, where we're able to really keep our fingers on the pulse of the customer. And the feedback that we're getting has been pretty universal. As I mentioned earlier, it's solid across the geographies and the segments. So we're feeling very good about the balance of the year. Obviously, getting to a little bit of a slower start than we would like to have seen, but still feeling really good about where we're headed. Okay. And then just on Consumer Brands. You mentioned that you're very well positioned across all North American retail channels. Can you also expand on that? Do you think that channel itself will improve in 2019 versus the past couple of years? Or is it your specific positioning post the share shift that you're particularly excited about? Well, I think our customers should hold us accountable to help them improve their results. We want to work with our customers and help them reach their goals. So we continue to work with those partners, working to drive their success. And we do that by helping to ensure that our products are consistent and high quality. The brands are strong. We have the right relationships in the right channels with the right assortment allows us to bring that value to the customers that we have and the consumers that they serve. And each one of those customers offer a unique opportunity of growth, and we're making sure that we're aligning our people, our resources, everything that we have to help them reach their goals. So we want to help those customers outpace the market. John or Al, you guys talked initially about your synergies from integrating Valspar. You mentioned that some of those manufacturing maybe would be a little longer tail. Can you give us an update on the progress there and what's left to come? Yes, Bob. We're still working through it by region. As we talked about, the longer tail on those is predominantly in the industrial space, which are more complicated and take longer to get done. I would say there are amounts in our $415 million run rate that we talked about coming out of this year, but we'll get those fine-tuned here in the next quarter or 2 and try to give more color around those as we go forward this year. And Bob, I know you and I have talked about this to some degree. Our goal is certainly to attack those synergies, but we're not going to do it at the cost of a customer. The goal is not to get just the cost out. We want to become more efficient, no question about it. But we're taking our time to make sure that we're taking the right steps. And as these synergies roll in, we want to make sure that it's a more favorable experience for our customers and put our salespeople in a better position to serve those customers. And can I ask your Lowe's business now, you're the single-line paint supplier there? Can you talk about how that makes you a better supplier at the paint aisle, or better at Lowe's having sort of a uniform or unified supply strategy there? Sure. It ensures the terrific alignment that I touched on earlier. We are looking at a collaborative view of how do we help our customer reach their goals. And so sharing of information and the tactics that we use are certainly in line with their goals. And it allows us to have more open dialogue with how to best help them reach those goals. And so there's a lot of momentum there. There's terrific leadership team that is driven to improve those results, and we want to make sure that our resources are in line with the goals that they have. Bob, you were talking about your outlook for second half raw material cost potentially being down year-over-year. Does that conviction come from your purchasing costs for raws today being down year-over-year, that will flow through COGS in the next couple of quarters? Yes. That's part of it, Steve, that we have been building inventory with lower-cost petrochemical raws. Part of it is the lag that our suppliers have in passing through lower-cost feedstocks and those feedstocks working their way through the acrylic chain. And I'd say probably the latter point is most of it. Okay. And John, you mentioned that some of your contractor customers have what you described as unseasonably high backlog. Other than maybe a break in the last 6 months' worth of weather, is there anything else that you could see holding them back from accelerating the execution of that backlog, such as access to good labor? Well, labor's clearly a piece of that, no question about it. And I think the -- first, the projects aren't going to go away. I mean it's a robust bidding market right now. So there's a great deal of confidence on the part of our customers. And I'd say to your point about the labor, we look at this as the opportunity for us to shine to our customers. As they get under more pressure to serve their customers, the model that we have, the products that we have, the service that we provide, the alignment that we can reach with our customers becomes more valuable to those customers. It's our opportunity to help them be more successful. So while it's a challenge for many of our customers from the volume standpoint, they become more dependent on us, and we like that. We like to demonstrate what we can do and how we can help them be more successful. Thinking about the sales outlook for the year, the 4% to 7%. With 2% in the first quarter and between 2% and 5%, I understand, obviously, there's some comps issue in the later start to the painting season. You mentioned the backlogs. I've seen in the prior question earlier in your comments, obviously, it's giving you confidence. What else can you kind of describe for us in terms of what gives you the confidence to get to that 4% to 7% range for the year? For example, trends in April. Has the construction season gotten off to a more robust start with the later start, perhaps later in March? Just if you could kind of give us a little bit more color please on the outlook? Nishu, the start to April is in line with the sales guidance we gave. And we talked about 2% to 5% with our North American stores being not only at the high end but above the high end, and we feel good about that guidance. As far as the second half, you got to remember, our first half has the toughest comps. Performance Coatings did 9.8% in the first quarter, 11% in the second quarter. So we're going up against a 10% quarter. Our store comps were 6.8% last year in our second quarter. And as you know, our second half tailed off. So if you look at comparisons, up mid -- almost high single digits in the first half and low single digits in the second half. The other thing I would talk about, some of the headwinds that we're facing in our first half will start to annualize. And it's the exited business in the U.S. that will annualize. It's the Guardsman divestiture, and even some of the tariff impacts that we saw in our industrial businesses. And then the final piece of that is our FX year-over-year comparison gets easier in the second half. We were basically neutral in the first half on FX last year and over 1%. And so now, we're saying we're going to be a little bit over 2 -- or a little bit over 2 in the first quarter. That will be a little bit below 2 because of seasonality. But then in the second half, we have easier comps. So it's a grouping of many things that goes into our confidence in the second half. Yes. I'd like to add to that if I could, Nishu. I think your question is a good one about the confidence of our customers. And I think Al talked about a lot of really good points there. A few others that I'd like to expand on. One is we're not waiting for things to happen here. We don't open our doors and hope people come in. We're very aggressive and active in trying to grow our business. And while our customers are confident with their pipeline, we also hedge our bets in making sure that we have growth. So we've talked over the last couple of years about our share of wallet initiatives as well as our new account activity. We've been very aggressive over the first quarter, really driving those activities inside our stores. So we're excited about not only what will happen from our existing customers, but the opportunity to grow in both new account and share of wallet to start with. Second, the investments that we're making give us a lot of confidence, in new stores, in new reps, new products. I mean, we want to keep pushing that pipeline full of reasons for customers to continue to switch to Sherwin-Williams. I want to make it easier for our employees to be in front of those customers with something to increase the value proposition. And then finally, if you look at the other pieces of the business, consumer benefits, we think, are strong as we get better alignment with our customers. And we believe that -- we talk a lot about Lowe's and we're excited about that, and we believe there's a lot of opportunity. But there's a lot of opportunity with our other customers in those segments as well. And on the PCG side, I mean, those businesses coming together with terrific synergies and products, people, relationships, specifications. It's hard for us to look at any one piece of our business and not be excited about the balance of the year. Focusing in on the Consumer Brands Group. If you factor out the Guardsman divestiture and currency, the 4%, call it, organic sales growth you saw there, and I'm not including obviously the inventory load in 3Q, it's the strongest quarter you've had there in a while. And especially with the late start to the painting season and the weakness overseas, it implies just a really nice result in North America there. Are there any one-off factors that might kind of temper the enthusiasm a little bit about the potential there? Was there some reloading ahead of the spring season? Just anything that might have boosted what looks like a pretty strong result in North America? For the most part, Nishu, no. It's hard to draw that line at the end of the quarter to say which, in any one year, might fall on the one side of the line or the other. But the way you've asked your question is much easier to answer. There's nothing that we can point to, to say this happened this year versus last year. We think, to your point, the team is executing. We're implementing a good strategy. But we still are very excited about what's ahead of us as well. This is actually Steve Haynes on for Vincent. Just wondering if you guys can maybe just elaborate a little bit more on your titanium dioxide pricing outlook this year. And whether you're thinking that maybe after a sustained period of inventory destocking, whether or not the coatings industry goals maybe need to restock in the back half? Yes. We'll see to what extent the softness in demand over the last quarter or 2 has been destocking versus just a slowdown in demand, particularly outside of North America. We think demand remains pretty robust in North America. It is likely the tightest TiO2 market if you look across the regions, and I think the pricing reflects that. The pricing in TiO2 has been relatively stable over the last couple of quarters. That's our expectation going forward. It's not to say that we're not going to see pricing announcements. But unless you see the supply/demand balance tighten meaningfully from here, I'm not sure to what extent any future pricing in that announcement are going to get traction. Our outlook is for stable -- relatively stable pricing over the balance of the year. Bob, just a question on your outlook for the architecture paint market in North America, both what you saw as growth in '18 and what you think could happen in '19. A particular question is we've seen a lot of strength in remodeling the last few years. That appears to be slowing. And I know Harvard was out recently calling for much more of a slowing in 2019. So do you agree with that outlook? And if so, what would be the implications for the U.S. architectural paint market and your growth? Good question, Don. As a reminder, where we stand right now from an industry standpoint, more than 80% of gallon volume in the industry is going into the repaint markets, both residential and nonresidential. So it is what will drive industry volume over the foreseeable future. We think it's an oversimplification to assume that turnover is the only driver of remodeling activity. In fact, if you look at all the historical drivers of U.S. remodeling activity, only one, albeit an important one, that is existing home turnover, has stalled over the last 12 to 18 months. The others, including aging housing stock, home value appreciation, strong employment backdrop, consumer confidence, et cetera, remain intact. And I'd argue, a lot of those are getting stronger. The other kind of difference in this cycle is in recent years, there have been some unique nontraditional factors driving demand for remodeling. For example, the baby boomers' decision, at least up to this point, to age in place. Baby boomers represent about 1/3 of owner-occupied households that over the last couple of years have accounted for about 50% of the remodeling spend. And we're not seeing that slow down, at least there's no indication that, that's slowing down. As I mentioned in my previous comments on the housing market in general, the conversion of single-family rentals and vacant homes back to owner-occupied, we've actually seen a reversal in the rate of homeownership. It's been declining or stagnant for years. Now we're seeing it start to tick back up as those rental -- single-family rentals are being absorbed by owners. And it's important to note that the roughly 3 million housing units that went from rental or vacant to owner-occupied over the last couple of years, on average, are in higher disrepair than an existing home transaction would generally be, and therefore require more remodeling and higher spend per unit than a typical existing home transaction. And so our conclusion is absent a recession, these factors are going to continue to drive growth in remodeling spend at higher rates than overall growth in the housing market. And it's true that Harvard has lowered their outlook for 2019, but we're still above 5% remodeling spend. And we also believe that you're likely to see kind of a shift away from high ticket, which has been driving a lot of the remodeling spend over the last few years, to a lower ticket, which primarily is painting and decorating. Don, I'd only add a couple of seconds here. We've got 5 years of double-digit compounded growth in our res repaint business. We believe we're uniquely positioned to capitalize on the paint portion of that remodel opportunity. And it's an area of focus for us. It's likely one of the largest opportunities we have as a company. And so, we're very excited about the opportunity in this space. I actually had 2. First, I wanted to get your thoughts on wins. I know local and regional builders and property managers are something you guys have been focused on. So I just want an update there. And then my second question is, as we look at the year to get at the high end of your plan or maybe even above, what would you think would drive that? So a 2-part question. So on the first piece, Scott, when you talk about wins, I'm assuming you're talking about winning business. Is that what you're referencing there? Yes. Yes. So coming into the year, we've -- on the new residential side, we've now reached 18 of the top 20 new residential builders. So that was up 1 of the top 20 in the last -- I think it was in the late third or fourth quarter. We're still pushing very hard on the large builders. But we're also very, very focused on the regional builder. And we're doing quite well there as well. On property management, it's been a terrific focus of our team in The Americas Group. And we're uniquely qualified here, as you would expect, with our platforms just to distribute product and fulfill the needs of these customers on a national basis. So there's good progress there. Our numbers in the property management area are very similar in ratio of wins of the top 20 property management as they are in new residential. Scott, I would say the -- to get to the high end of the range, it's really the level of North America Paint Stores volume. But I would also say on North America volume across Consumer and Performance Coatings, it's still by far the largest segment we have or geography we have. And that would have dictate where we fall onto the range. It's Mike Leithead on for Duffy this morning. First, in North America, your Paint Stores, I was hoping regionally you could give us some sort of sense of the magnitude of delta between your best and worst region. I guess I'm just trying to get a sense of how hit the Midwest was from a demand standpoint because of some of the weather activities there. Yes. Just a second to look at that here. I would say that the -- well, I'll say it this way that the Midwest and the Southwest were hit pretty hard in the year. The delta -- I don't know that we're going to share that information. We're all looking at each other like we don't share that information. And then... Go ahead. And then second question just on raw materials versus volumes. It seems like most people anticipate coatings volumes to accelerate in the second half of the year. Yet raw material inflation is expected to stay relatively flat or even I think maybe potentially come down like you were saying earlier, Bob. I guess is there any concern as demand picks up, there may be inflationary pressure on raw mats? Or are there other factors that hold raw materials back from that? Well, first, Mike, to be clear, our growth outlook for the back half of the year doesn't necessarily -- we're not necessarily expecting industry volume to inflect at the same rate. We think industry volume was a little subdued in the first quarter. But our expectation to accelerate growth in the second quarter and especially in the back half is more -- pertains more to our business than it does to the industry. You're absolutely right. If we see a strong pickup in industry volume, it's likely to tighten some markets for raw materials. That's a high-quality problem. Just on that point on the volumes. Just curious on your comp performance in Q1 versus your own expectations and how you see that progressing through the year. Assuming that the comp on the volume side was at the 1% to 2% range, could that accelerate as we go through the year? Just curious just given that there has been some changes and Q1 and Q4 seem to be not as weak versus Q2 and Q3 in years past. Yes. Arun, the low single-digit gallon growth that we realized in our first quarter was softer than we were expecting. And when you look at our second quarter sales guidance, the 2% to 5%, and our Paint Stores at -- above that range, it tells you that we're going to see accelerating volume in the second quarter. And we would expect that similar cadence going up against the weaker second half. Yes. Just in conversations with our customers, I mean, they're very clear about their inability to get to that painting phase on the projects that they're on. So these projects are there. They're eager to get to them. We expect that they will be, and we're looking forward to serving that. And just as a follow up, very strong margins in consumer. The other 2 were a little bit, I guess, lighter. But from your own kind of vantage point, if you do see this volume kind of improve, do you expect a material improvement in your margins in both segments and especially on the gross line as well? Yes. I'd say, in Consumer Group, part of the improvement we saw in our operating margin was good, tight cost control that, that team has been exhibiting throughout the past year and with realizing synergies. Their gross margin was actually flat year-over-year. So they have had to implement pricing. And as we get volume to that group, I would expect margin expansion. The level of the sequential margin expansion will depend on volume. The 16.9% was a pretty excitable quarter. On Performance Coatings, I would say we're very happy with the progress we're making on our operating margin -- our core operating margin being up 30 basis points. We saw the team has made good progress on pricing and again there's synergy realization in there. And when you talk about it sequentially, I just want to be clear. That's a volume issue. And if you look at our sequential gross margins, they were actually up. So we're making good progress. We have a lot of confidence in our medium-term operating margin targets of high teens to low 20s. Yes. I'd say that the Performance Coatings Group's efforts in this area of pricing and margin really has been terrific. Those prices continue to roll into the first quarter. Our efforts are going to continue throughout the year. So to Al's point, we're pleased with the consumer side, but we're really excited about the Performance Coatings margins. We expect those to continue. Great. And just a quick follow-up, if I can, on the MA front. Maybe you can just discuss your priorities for buybacks versus MA. Have you seen any kind of bolt-ons emerge that are attractive to you? And if so, which areas would those be in? And if not, would all the excess cash, I guess, go towards buybacks? Yes. I'll take the first piece, Arun. We are looking business by business, and we often talk about our approach to our MA is driven by business unit. So we look by business, then by geography to understand if there are voids that we should be pursuing. And to us, we're not trying to be everything to everyone, everywhere. We're really determined on executing our strategy and taking a very disciplined approach to that. We have an increased amount of activity. We're engaged in a number of potential targets. And we're excited about the stage that we are in given the integration of Valspar and how some of these might be nice bolt-ons to our businesses. Yes. And as we talked about on our year-end call, in 2019, we're getting back to our historical cadence of capital allocation. And we talked about paying down $600 million of debt. $300 million of that is long term that comes due in June. The rest will be short term. Our CapEx we'll manage below 2%. As you know, we raised our dividend over 31% in the first quarter and expect that for the year. And then in the first quarter, we also bought back 750,000 shares of our stock for $305 million. So you look at for the first quarter, we returned $410 million to our shareholders. That's a 27% increase year-over-year. And you can be assured. Absent MA, we're going to buy back our stock. It is a high-level question for you regarding your first quarter sales variance. You reported 1.9%. I think the prior expectation was 2% to 6%. And so in explaining that variance, I think you called out the slower start in the States and challenging conditions overseas. I'm just wondering which one of those was more important. Or whether they were equally important in terms of explaining the variance versus your prior expectation? Well, it's all a matter of which of our business leaders we're talking to. So I would tell you that we often talk about the stores business, our TAG, as the engine of the company. And so we always point to that model as a terrific model, but it truly is the engine of the company. And we like to see that engine going a little quicker. I mentioned just earlier that from a painting contractor's perspective, getting the painting phase of many projects in the quarter was a bit of a challenge. It's a smaller quarter for us. It's a smaller quarter for our painting contractors. So I don't think that they planned for perfection in the first quarter because of the volatility and the weather. And so they still remain very confident. That gives us great confidence. And as I mentioned, I think we're uniquely positioned to serve those customers. So on the architectural side, it's very, very important. On the industrial side, when we looked at the comparables there, the comps in the first quarter were up 9.8%. The second quarter were up 11%. So we're in the midst of the toughest comparison for both these businesses from a comp standpoint. Then it breaks down quite a bit down into the 4% range in the back half of the year. Meanwhile, we're continuing with our efforts and the momentum of growing our new accounts, the share of wallet and on the industrial side gaining ground as well. So architectural is important, the industrial is right behind it, but all of them important in our future growth. Okay. That's helpful. And then second, I want to ask you about the packaging coatings business. I think that I heard you say that it grew sales directionally. Any color with regard to volume, price and the outlook for the balance of the year there would be helpful. Yes. We have a terrific team in our packaging business, terrific technology, unique technology. I would tell you that, globally, our packaging was up in the mid-single digits. And they were up in every region that we participate in. So we've got good momentum. And we feel as though this is something that's only going to continue. Dmitry? First starting out with The Americas Group. Can you walk through the monthly trends in the quarter? And then also speak to maybe how things are shaping up in the April for that overall business in TAG? Yes. I think if you look at the -- let's start with April. As I said earlier, it's in line with our guidance of the 2% to 5% with stores being at slightly above that range. The first quarter, I would just say, January was strong and February and March were softer. Okay. Okay. So should we expect -- within the kind of the mapping of your guidance, should we expect pricing power within this business to change from that 2.5% cadence as we look to the balance of the year? Or is that 2.5% a good one to think about? I think it gets a little bit better as we go forward. I mean we talked about the effectiveness improving over a 9-month period, and that still holds today. Okay. And in terms of the segment margins say and thinking about looking to the second quarter, the idea of you being maybe at or above the high end of that 2% to 5% growth ambition. The implications for the second quarter in margins for TAG, do you expect that now flips to positive year-over-year as you look to 2Q? And then, obviously, in the back half is it going to be probably much better, but 2Q positive on a year-over-year basis? Yes, Justin. I'm not going to start giving guidance by segment. But as my earlier comments, with the demand outlook and the pricing that we just talked about, we expect to see margin expansion in the year. Yes. To reach our 13.5% increased EPS, it's baked in there. That's it. Sure. Sure. Okay. And then flipping -- switching gears to the Performance Coatings business. For that -- the intermediate-term plan and specific to 2020 margin plan, that high teens, the low-20% target by 2020, how much of that is under your control be it the pricing levers or the synergies? And how much of market growth are you going to need? And the reason I ask that is, is I'm looking at this international market remains fairly sluggish. Can you still get to that destination by 2020 from here? Because I think when I look at all the different businesses, this is the one that's deferred as put. So I just want to put that to you and see what your thoughts are there. Yes. Justin, first, we're going to give you an update on our 2020 guidance at our Investor Day in June. But we believe we have a number of factors that are in our control that help drive you to that target. One is volume and new account growth, the product innovation that John talked about, the movement in V70 on the packaging side. We still have opportunities for synergies within that group and both Consumer Brands with the majority of them being more focused towards Performance Coatings as we get into product reformulations and raw material changes and then we get into the facilities that we talked about earlier. So I think there's a number of things that are in our control that allow us to move towards that target. How quickly we get there is to be determined. Understood. And lastly, for me, in just terms of the Consumer Brands. Was there any load-in benefit versus the prior year? Because I believe the announcement was in February last year, where you had a sizable win, a notable win and a large customer. Was there any load-in benefit or tailwind year-over-year from that customer win that graduated into the quarter? Yes. I think just the normal ramping up for the season. I don't think there was anything dramatic or different for the most part, Justin. That's fully annualized. I guess you've anniversaried all of that tailwind. There's no more to come going forward in terms of just the apples-and-oranges benefit from that customer win. No. I'd say that we -- from an annualization standpoint, we had a little bit coming in, in Q2. The lion's share of it will be in Q3 from a comparison standpoint. Just wanted to follow up on a couple of sort of items outstanding. First of all, in your Americas business, your Latin American group, given the high teens declines in foreign exchange, was that a positive operating performance quarter for the group or not so much? Both the top line and bottom line would have been dilutive year-over-year. So you lost a little bit money on the EBIT line there as well. Okay. I'm just trying to understand kind of the old Paint Stores Group and see how well it did. Secondly, in terms of European and Asia Pacific demand environment, particularly for the industrial part of the business. Short of comps getting easier in the back end of the year, is there anything that you can see or are seeing or can point to? In other words, what would it take for the results there to get better at a macro level? And what is it that you're doing in addition to that to make sure you deliver the growth that you expect to deliver in the back end of the year? Yes. So you're talking about specifically Europe with this question, Dmitry? Europe and Asia Pacific. Okay. Sure. So in Europe, you're right. Overall, there was some softness there. As I mentioned, we did see packaging up in every region, so they were up in Europe. And we believe -- in Europe, we have some really terrific teams that are coming together in our general industrial, in our industrial wood businesses as well as our Protective Marine capabilities. So our goal there is to really start capitalizing on the combined company and the synergies that result from these 2 companies coming together. Al mentioned earlier about some of the synergies. Some of that comes in a way of cost savings, but what we're also anxious to do is to begin transferring the technology over there. And that's beginning now, but it certainly offers a terrific opportunity going forward. In Asia, again overall, a soft market. Some of that was the result of the implications of trade, where we saw our industrial wood business under tremendous pressure as more and more companies grappled with the impacts of the -- implications of the trade issues. Again, our packaging business was up. Our coil were up -- was up, and both of those were actually up in double digit in Asia. So good performance there. Our general industrial offers opportunity there that we're anxious to capitalize on. But we do think the industrial woods is going to be under some pressure for some time given everything that's going on. Okay. So it sounds like in -- you're definitely not looking for any kind of macro pickup. It's basically entirely sort of self-help. And in terms of Asia Pacific, the macro environment you're not optimistic at all it sounds like as we go in the second half. Well, I think in all these markets with our market share position, I mean, we've got terrific opportunities. Yes, we'd like to see the markets improve. But in an odd way, those grinding markets should position us to do even better. And we like to grind. We like the opportunity to get in and show that what we bring in solutions and products and services are differentiated. So if the market comes, that's great. If not, our teams know our expectations of them. We want to grow. Great. That's a very good answer. And last question, just in North American market given the little bit of a slow start, weather or otherwise, in the paint business. I noticed, particularly in Asia, there seems to be a little bit more promotional activity. Would -- as you look across your distribution channels, are you having to be a little bit more promotional this year? Or is it basically business as usual, and there's no incremental promotions that are needed to get the volume up? No. I don't think that there's any significant difference in the promotional activity that's taking place right now. We're certainly -- we don't feel as though that's necessary. Just want to clarify. On the volume ramp the rest of the year, I think there's a comment that was made that you expect to outpace the industry. Just want to be clear. Is this a broad-based comment across businesses? Or is this targeting TAG in particular? Well, we certainly believe that our TAG business is positioned to outpace the market. We've talked about that for many years. And the fact this year that we've got the new stores, new products, everything that we have going, we're really excited about this year's season. In fact, not only just everything from investment and resource standpoint but the activity that our teams have demonstrated in this additional area that we've talked about and I think may not be valued as much as we value by some of our investors, which is the new account activity and share of wallet. So we absolutely see a terrific ramp to outpace the market in our stores business. Outside of that, when you say is it just limited to our stores, I jokingly made the comment earlier. It depends on who inside our company we're talking to. But I say that tongue in cheek because the reality is when we sit and talk with every one of our businesses and we review the opportunities, it really is very exciting to talk about some of the things that we're on the verge on, the line trials that we're on, the promotional or the programs that we're working on with our customers. So we think we have a foot in the right direction in every one of these businesses. And that's not to say there won't be challenges, but we feel really good about where we are and where we're headed. Okay. And my follow-up question is just as you think of the new store openings going from 15 in Q1 to the 90 to 100 for the full year, how should that track the rest of the way? And are there any support costs or staffing costs that could be lumpy that we should be aware of? Yes. For the many, many years, we've been opening stores at 90 to 100. We'll open 15 in the first quarter, and then we'll open 35-ish in the fourth quarter. And the rest find their way in the second and third quarters and... Third and fourth quarter. Third and fourth. And there's no lumpiness to the expense that you'd expect. I want to switch subject a little bit. The deferred pension asset dropped more than [$200,000] year-over-year. And Al, could you give us the implications what that means to earnings per share and cash flows going forward? And even what happened to cash flows in the first quarter as the annuities were purchased and how it impacted the financial statements, please? Sure. The annuity purchase came out of the defined benefit plans. It did not impact the net operating cash that were reported. That really was -- the net operating cash impact was really an increase in our working capital and primarily architectural inventory to get ready for the spring selling season to make sure we're servicing our customers at a very, very high level. The impact of the pension settlement and annuity, we took a $32.4 million hit. That's another income and expense. It allowed us to monetize the overfunded pension plan that we had, and it's a little over the $200 million in cash that we now have available to us to fund our defined contribution pension plan, and which we used $65 million in February to fund that contribution. So going forward, that allows us another good 3 or 4 years, where instead of the company having to outlay cash, we'll use that money that came out of that DB plan. All right, great. Any way to put, Al, an annual EPS number on that, what it benefits? You know what, we haven't, Chuck. I mean it's not material -- it's baked into our guidance and not material year-over-year to call out, so we didn't. When you look at your business, how much of your paint is ordered online? And who's ordering online? Is it mostly contractors or DIY customers? Can you just talk about sort of online purchases of paint? It's a relatively small percentage of our purchases, and it's nearly all professional contractors that are using that. We do have, P.J., a program that's continuing to ramp up in the area of this e-commerce to allow customers to do more business with us. You'll see areas that we're testing in different parts of the country. And we would expect over the not-too-distant future to conduct more business over the Internet, but we don't want to -- we want to enhance. We don't want to replace our stores. We want to enhance the service and the capabilities of our stores and our reps through e-commerce. And we believe this is going to be a terrific tool to allow our customers to get the most out of the resources that we bring to the table. Would you say it's less than 5% of this? Yes. Yes. Okay. And then one last question. You didn't talk much about Valspar's industrial business, particularly the big machinery business with Cat and Deere. I was wondering what's going on in that business and what trends you are seeing. I'm sorry. The question was... The John Deere. I'd say, overall, our business there is doing well. We, again, have a lot of respect for these customers. We're working hard to bring more solutions to them. I'd say this was an area that when you look at the combination of our companies, both technical organizations were working on opportunities to enhance features of the product to help our customers. One company had solved one area of an issue, and the other one had supplied another. And when we got our technical teams together, we really found an opportunity to enhance what we believe to be as a terrific solution for those customers, but also that might be expandable into other areas as well. So it's an exciting part of our business, one that we expect to continue to grow. I'll try and keep it brief. I just want to make sure I got the pricing dynamic right. 2.5% was the pricing mix in The Americas Group comp. If we looked at Performance Coatings, should we assume that the price realized was something north of that, maybe 3.5% or 4%, if my backup math is correct? Then I had a follow up for Al. You know what, Greg, I would say the way that pricing rolls in is more choppy than our stores that I talked about. And I would say it's not quite that high. But it would have been just -- it would be higher than -- I'm just looking at the math. If I add back the FX for North America to have grown 4%, there must have been more price in Performance Coatings than in Americas Group? Or... No, I'd say a similar amount, and our volume was up low single digits in Performance Coatings. All right, fair. That's what I was looking for. And then second, on the guidance for the full year, could you remind us what the tax rate you guys are using for that at the midpoint or in a range? And then link that to the buyback as well. I mean you had more buyback than we had, at least in the first quarter. Do you look at that $300 million this first quarter as sort of a new higher level of run rate? Or just given where the share price was, you're more opportunistic if you think about the full year? Yes. The tax rate -- and I'll talk to the core tax rate. We expect to be in the low 20%. Obviously, we're a little bit lower than that in the first quarter, but comparable with last year because of the favorable impact you get on stock comp is heavier in the first quarter. Just historically, there's been more options exercised. Then we have some vesting of our issues. As far as the share buybacks, I think we are going to be opportunistic and we were in the first quarter with where we saw our stock price. I think you have done the math on free cash flow on our last call and got a little bit higher directionally than I would have been. I think your number was $800 million to $1 billion. So I might be a little bit lower than that, but it's going to depend on the MA activity and how that unfolds throughout the year. That will determine how much we ultimately buy. So it sounds like for purposes of guidance, you're still assuming maybe a couple million shares for the year, not 3 million or 4 million? That's fair. Wanted to ask a couple questions on the Lowe's business. Specifically about the bottom line contribution that you saw in Q1 and what you're expecting in Q2. Can you just talk about how that played out compared to your expectations? And are the costs related to that Lowe's business where you want them at this point? Yes, Mike. Out of respect for all our customers, we don't want to comment on any individual customer impact on our results. Now as far as the costs go, we did lay out the fact that we were going to take a $50 million charge, and about 40% of that was onetime. So that remaining $30 million, if you will, is spread pretty evenly out through the 4 quarters of '19. All right. And then one of your competitors that serves the DIY market sounded a little bit more optimistic about trends in DIY. Wondering if you share that view. And if so, what do you think is generating some of that improvement? Well, we're certainly positive about the space. We think that, as I mentioned earlier, working with our partners to drive their success is important. Our view is that we're providing customers the brands and the quality of product that can help separate them from our -- or alignment with their customers. I will say that during that process, we always are making sure that we have the right relationships and that we're in the right channels and with the right assortments with the right customers. So that review is something that's ongoing and something that we work very hard on. Once those decisions are made, then we work really hard to align ourselves and put our customers in the best position to win. All right. And last question I had. I was just wondering, John, if you can comment on the recent personnel changes. I know you promoted David Sewell to COO and then made some changes at the top of Performance Coatings and Consumer. Is this just moving people up the ladder? Or does it suggest a more significant changes going on strategically at the top of those 2 segments? No. I think if you look, historically, Mike, at the company, I think it's 27 over the last 32 years we've had a Chief Operating Officer. The company is -- we have strong expectations. And we want to grow. We want to grow fast. And I believe David Sewell is a wonderful, talented leader that can help us accomplish our goals. Aaron Erter into our Performance Coatings is, I think, a tribute to the commitments that we have in identifying talent and making sure that they have the experiences to continue to develop. Rob Lynch backfilling Aaron Erter, I mean I can go down the list. I mean we work really hard at developing a strong depth of talent to be able to execute what it is that we're trying to do. But what we're trying to do is grow. And my belief in having a COO is specifically targeted at helping us to drive our business with more speed. I was wondering if you could give us an update on the refinishing. Could you give us some details on the trends, whether it is in North America and in international markets? Yes. I'd say refinishing in North America, Rosemarie, was a relatively soft market. And I'd say that we are kind of floating right with the market, and that doesn't bode well for us as you would expect. Our expectations for our teams are not to run with the market. So we feel as though we're positioned well. We've got some new technology that we think can help to expedite the efforts that we have. We've got -- it's oddly enough another opportunity of the synergies of the 2 companies come together. We have an Ultra K -- Ultra 9k technology that's a waterborne technology that we believe is a wonderful quality product, great color, helps in productivity, all the levers that you would look at for vehicle refinish. And so while our performance in the first quarter reflected kind of what we see in the market, not only in North America, I would say around the world for the most part, our expectations for this team going forward will be to outperform the market. We feel we're holding our own, I guess, would be the answer. So with everyone texting and teenagers doing all of that at the wheel of a truck, why do you think the demand is so slow? I am assuming you are counting on accidents in order to grow that particular business. Well, we don't like when you frame it exactly that way. But there are drivers that certainly have some impact on it. I'd say that there's a general softness in the market. And we believe that there are opportunities for this business. And so, overall, I think collisions industry-wide were down in the low single digits. But again, when I look at our market share opportunities, there are growth opportunities for us, and that's what we're working with our teams to capture. So even with AI causing cars to stop by itself even if someone is just trying to do the wheel, you still think that with the market decline you can still gain share and grow? Yes. And part of that comes to what I talked about earlier as far as the technology. All of these creates pressure in a segment, and that pressure forces people to find better solutions to what it is that they're trying to do. There are going to be some accidents out there. And so if you look at the opportunity to help those customers whose business might be under pressure because of everything that you just described, those customers are going to be looking for solutions that help them do what they want to do more profitably. We think we can help our customers accomplish that goal by bringing them the solutions to win. That is very helpful. And if I could just have one last question in terms of China and the demand, which obviously had slowed down because of tariffs, but seems to be picking up in terms of domestic demand. Would that be helping? Are you seeing it, first of all? And is it mostly in your wood business that you would see it if it is occurring? Well, part of that has to do with the focus of our businesses. I would say that we're looking more into that domestic business, Rosemarie, but it's not been a primary area of our focus. So while we're looking to grow in those areas, that speaks more to the point I made earlier about the fact that given our market share and the opportunity to grow, that we need always to be looking for those opportunities regardless of what's happening in the market. We've not been traditionally solely focused on one area, but we've been more focused on the exported products than we have been the domestic market. And so that gives us a terrific opportunity to grow forward in the future. Thank you, Jessie. I'd like to thank you all for joining us on this, my last quarterly earnings call. It's been my pleasure working with you all over the last 17 years, and I'm confident I'm leaving you in very capable hands with Jim Jaye. As usual, Jim and I will be available to take any follow-up questions over the balance of the week. We also hope you will join us in Cleveland on June 5 for our annual Financial Community Presentation. Again, just contact us if you need the registration link. Thanks again for joining us, and thanks for your continued interest in Sherwin-Williams.\",\n          \"    Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the HanesBrands Quarterly Investor Conference Call. (Operator Instructions) As a reminder, today's conference may be recorded. I'd now like to introduce your host for today's conference, Mr. T. C. Robillard. Sir, please go ahead.     Good day, everyone, and welcome to the Hanesbrands' quarterly investor conference call and webcast. We are pleased to be here today to provide an update on our progress after the first quarter of 2018. Hopefully, everyone has had a chance to review the news release we issued earlier today. The news release, updated FAQ document and a replay of this call can be found in the Investor section of our hanes.com website. On the call today, we may make forward looking statements, either in our prepared remarks or in the associated question and answer session. These statements are based on current expectations or beliefs and are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially. These risks are detailed in our various filings with the SEC and may be found on our website as well as in our news releases. The company does not undertake to update or revise any forward looking statements, which speak only to the time at which they are made. Unless otherwise noted, today's references to our consolidated financial results as well as our 2018 guidance represent continuing operations and exclude all acquisition, integration and other action related charges and expenses. Additional information, including a reconciliation of these and other non GAAP performance measures to GAAP, can be found in today's press release. With me on the call today are Gerald Evans, our Chief Executive Officer; and Barry Hytinen, our Chief Financial Officer. For today's call, Gerald and Barry will provide some brief remarks, and then we'll open it up to your questions. I will now turn the call over to Gerald.     Thank you, T.C. HanesBrands delivered solid first quarter results with respect to revenue, operating profit, earnings per share and cash flow. We are encouraged by our start to the year. That said, we have 3 quarters remaining, and we are staying focused on executing our long term strategy while also delivering short term results. Several years ago, we began a focused strategy to diversify beyond being simply a U.S. business with a global supply chain to becoming a worldwide business that fully leverages the power of our global supply chain. Over this time, we've built a leadership position in our 2 core categories around the world. We've also expanded our distribution to include online, continuing our commitment to offer our products everywhere our consumers wish to purchase them. Our diversification actions have reduced our dependency on the U.S. wholesale market, while at the same time, providing us multiple paths to deliver more consistent organic growth. In the quarter, we saw further evidence that our revenue diversification efforts are taking hold. Organic sales increased 1% in constant currency, driven by strong growth across 3 of our key initiatives: International, Champion and online. This growth more than offset the expected brick and mortar declines within the U.S. wholesale channel. Looking at our sales by product category. Global Innerwear sales increased 2% in the quarter, driven by exchange rates and the addition of Bras N Things. On an organic constant currency basis, sales declined roughly 3%. In March, we launched our ComfortFlex Fit innovation in U.S. men's underwear with a coordinated media campaign during the NCAA basketball tournament, and we're pleased with the initial sales trends we're seeing from this new innovation. We also increased our media spend during the quarter to support our new Bonds product line in Australia as well as our U.S. intimates business. Our U.S. intimates business, while down compared to last year, performed as expected. More specifically, our U.S. bra business, where our turnaround initiatives are more advanced, was down 2% in the quarter, a sequential improvement from the 5% decline in the fourth quarter. We're beginning to see early signs of sales and market share stabilization in our bra business, which we credit to the new programs we have placed at key strategic retailers. We are encouraged by the improved point of sale trends where we have placed these programs, and we believe we are on track for a continued sequential improvement in our U.S. intimates business as the year progresses. Global Activewear sales increased 15% over last year or 8% on an organic constant currency basis. This was ahead of our expectations, as we benefited from the earlier placement of some of our spring product offerings for Champion. For the quarter, our Champion revenue grew 17% globally in constant currency, with high single digit growth in the U.S. and strong double digit growth in both Asia and Europe. The global growth in Champion more than offset the anticipated space reduction in our Hanes casualwear business within the U.S. mass channel. Our Activewear strategy for the past several years has been to drive revenue and margin growth by focusing on the branded segments of the market while de emphasizing the commodity segments. This brand focused strategy has been working in both our domestic and our international businesses. Going forward, we'll continue to concentrate on the higher return segments and channels of the market by leveraging our strong brands, Champion and Hanes as well as our latest addition, the Alternative brand. Turning to acquisitions. Alternative Apparel is performing well, and though it wasn't part of our company a year ago, revenue was up 8% over last year. Alternative adds another solid brand to our portfolio, one with a strong millennial and sustainability appeal. While we have only owned Bras N Things for roughly 2 months, it's an extremely well run business and is shaping up to be a great acquisition. We've inherited a strong management team, a leading brand in Australia with a core millennial customer base and a demonstrated omni channel model. As we committed last quarter, we expect to complete the integrations of our current deals by the end of 2019. At which time, we expect to have no more charges related to our prior acquisitions. Touching briefly on capital allocation. Our plan for this year is to digest our acquisitions and pay down debt, with a focus on getting back within our targeted leverage range of 2 to 3x net debt to EBITDA. So in closing, we're encouraged by the solid start to the year but recognize we have work to do. We're looking forward to seeing many of you at our headquarters in 2 weeks for our Investor Day, where you'll get a chance to interact with many of our global business leaders. You'll also hear about our strategies to unleash our full potential to generate shareholder returns, as we leverage everything we've been building over the past several years. With that, I'll turn the call over to Barry.     Thanks, Gerald. Let me begin by highlighting that today's commentary regarding operating profit and operating margin reflects the accounting rule change regarding pension expense as well as our segment allocation change as it relates to certain corporate overhead costs. All prior period results reflect these changes, and we've provided a table on our Investor Relations website that recast 2016 and 2017. For the quarter, sales were $1.47 billion, an increase of $91 million over last year and up 1% organically in constant currency. Operating profit of $166 million and operating margin of 11.3% were both modestly ahead of our expectations. Adjusted and GAAP earnings per share were $0.26 and $0.22, respectively, and cash flow from operations was a use of $128 million. With that summary, let's turn to the details of the quarter's results. Sales increased 6.6% over last year and included $32 million from the contributions of our recent acquisition of Alternative Apparel and Bras N Things as well as a $45 million benefit from the effects of foreign exchange rates. Gross margin declined 10 basis points over last year, modestly below our outlook for a slight increase as expansion in our international gross margin was offset by higher input cost, which were expected. I will note that we experienced $14 million of raw material inflation in the quarter. Absent this inflation, our gross margin would have been up 80 basis points. Operating margin declined 60 basis points compared to last year. Absent the impact of   from raw material inflation, operating margin would have been up 30 basis points. Other factors weighing on our operating margin in the quarter were the anticipated increases in both media investments and distribution costs. For the quarter, our media investment was $5 million higher than last year, driven by the items Gerald referenced in his comments, while distribution cost were impacted by the short term labor inefficiencies we spoke about last quarter. Looking at the second half. We've secured the planned price increases for this year that we spoke about on our last call. We've begun to communicate our planned price increases for 2019, and we're progressing on our plans to improve distribution efficiencies, all of which gives us confidence that we are on track to return to operating margin expansion in the second half. Our 16% tax rate in the quarter was in line with our expectations and included $4 million of one time expense related to a tax law change in one of our foreign jurisdictions. GAAP EPS of $0.22 increased 16% over last year, as we incurred much lower acquisition and other related charges. Adjusted EPS of $0.26 declined 10% versus last year. Now given the recent U.S. tax reform, I would note that if the prior year's tax rate was at 16%, our adjusted EPS would have been consistent year on year. For the quarter, acquisition and other related charges were $20 million, a decrease of $19 million from last year. We continue to expect 2018 charges to be $80 million. We are on track to complete the integrations of our current deals over the next 18 months and expect 2019 to mark the end of one time charges related to all of our prior acquisitions. Consistent with our normal seasonality, cash flow from operations was a use in the quarter and was in line with our expectation. I would note, first quarter's cash flow from operations included $28 million for the previously disclosed earn out payment related to our acquisition of Champion Europe. Now let me take you through our segment performance. U.S. Innerwear sales declined 3% compared to last year, as both basics and intimates were in line with our expectations. intimates sales declined approximately 7%, while basics sales were down just under 1%. On a rolling 12 month basis, we believe we gained market share in basics, driven by men's underwear and socks, as we outperformed the overall decline in the category. Point of sale trends within basics were better than expected in the mass channel and mixed in the department store and mid tier channels. Innerwear operating margins declined approximately 240 basis points versus last year, primarily due to the impact from higher raw material cost as well as the lower sales volume. Turning to U.S. Activewear. Sales increased 6% over last year due to the $16 million contribution from Alternative Apparel and a 1% increase in organic sales. The increase in organic sales exceeded our expectations as growth in Champion and replenishment Activewear more than offset the expected space declines in our mass business that Gerald referred to earlier. With respect to Champion, sales outside of the mass channel increased over 50% in the quarter, driven by strong consumer demand, space gains in the specialty channels and growth in the online channel. This more than offset a decline in the Champion mass business, which we believe is mature. Activewear operating margins declined 210 basis points in the quarter to 11.1%, as favorable product mix was more than offset by the impact from higher raw material and distribution costs. As we discussed last quarter, through pricing and distribution efforts, we expect these particular headwinds to be mitigated in the second half. In our International segment, sales increased 19% or $92 million. It was $16 million from the contribution of Bras N Things and $45 million from the effects of foreign exchange rates. On a constant currency basis, organic sales increased approximately 7% compared to last year and exceeded our expectations. The primary driver of that performance was strong demand for our Champion brand, particularly in Asia where sales grew 30% and in Europe where sales grew 23% versus last year. Growth in both regions was broad based, including online, our retail stores and wholesale. International operating margins were strong, increasing 250 basis points over last year, primarily due to scale efficiencies, favorable mix and the continued realization of acquisition synergies. As we have discussed before, over time, we expect these same factors to drive further margin expansion in the International segment. With respect to leverage, we ended the quarter at 3.9x on a net debt to EBITDA basis. As Gerald discussed, we plan to de lever this year and expect to be approaching the high end of our target range by year end. In 2019, we expect to be back within our leverage range. Lastly, as it relates to guidance, we reiterated our full year outlook as well as issued second quarter guidance, so I'll point you to the press release and the FAQ document for any specifics. With respect to the second quarter, our outlook included the headwinds from raw material inflation, increased media investments and higher distribution costs that we discussed on last quarter's call. These are being partially offset by synergies and cost initiatives as well as contributions from our recent acquisitions. Our second quarter outlook also assumes that organic revenue on a constant currency basis declined less than 1% at the midpoint, reflecting our expectation for a decline in U.S. Innerwear as well as the shift of certain seasonal Champion programs into the first quarter that Gerald highlighted in his earlier remarks. So in closing, we delivered a solid quarter. While we remain cautious with respect to the U.S. wholesale environment, we're encouraged that our efforts to diversify our business continue to gain traction. Looking out over the next several quarters, we remain focused on returning to more consistent organic growth and margin expansion, completing our ongoing integrations and reducing our debt. With that, I'll turn the call back over to T.C.     Thanks, Barry. That concludes our prepared remarks. We will now begin taking your questions and will continue as time allows. (Operator Instructions) I will now turn the call back over to the operator to begin the question and answer session. Operator? Gerald, I guess, for you if you could talk through -- you know that the revenues look to be stabilizing here. But as it relates to Champion, could you guys maybe quantify -- it sounds like there's a little bit of a shift into 1Q. And then just more broadly what you're seeing from the Champion line on a global basis? Sure. Eric, very solid quarter for us. We really think that the year and certainly, this quarter are playing out as we expected. And as you noted, Champion has been one of our key initiatives from the standpoint of creating growth for the business. And we've got a great story going here. We've reunited the brand over the last few years and saw really strong growth in Champion across the world of 22%, 17% in constant currency, 8% in the U.S., 30% in Asia and 22% in Europe. So it's just really solid growth across the world in this business. And it's just not wholesale, it's online. And it's in our own stores, particularly in Asia and Europe. So we've really got broad growth coming through the business. And we see a real avenue for continued growth as we look forward. It's in the heritage products, but importantly, it's also in our performance products. They're also performing well, so we've got a broad product line initiatives well in the brand. And we're really seeing a lot of momentum out of our consumer engagement efforts as well, as we bring the consumer -- a younger consumer into the franchise in particular. So really good momentum and really we're seeing a lot of the results of what we set out to build a couple of years ago. So feeling really good about it. And then if I could just follow up as it relates to the raw material input cost inflation. I appreciate and it sounds like you guys are relatively locked in for the year. But as we think about the price increases, maybe just walk through where we should be seeing those sort of the elasticity assumption that you all might have within the various segments. I'm assuming it's within the Champion, but if it is within the Domestic Innerwear, how do you guys think about that elasticity? Yes, Eric. Thanks for the question. This is Barry. Raw material is really playing out very much in line with our expectations. We thought the year would have a net impact net of pricing of $30 million to $35 million of raw material impact, and that's what we see today. I noted the amount we incurred in the first quarter, which was about $14 million. And that's broad-based as it relates to commodities and things of that nature. As it relates to the pricing for 2018 that we talked about on our last call that we are working to communicate, that's all secured at this point. You're right. You know the business well. You would expect those to be in kind of the seasonal program in some of the Champion. As it relates to -- as we look out into 2019, we've begun communicating the pricing actions that will take to offset the rest of this inflation, and we would expect to have those in place in early '19, and that's really across the rest of the business. I would note, if you think about the total net impact that we're incurring this year as compared to our cost of goods sold for the company, it's a relatively small impact, but we will be pricing for it. And that's something the company has done for many years. Thanks for the question. Good to see the top line inflect. I was wondering in Innerwear, can you give some more color on the women's intimate? How much was driven by the door closures versus just weak sales in the existing doors? And then how much was shapewear and panties down? I think you said bras were down minus 2%. Sure. Susan, from a standpoint of intimates, as you know, this category has been challenging for some time. It's one that is more heavily distributed in the department store and mid-tier channels, and it's been most affected by door closures. First, I would tell you that we're encouraged that we see the category stabilizing as we overlap door closures, and that's a very positive sign to us. We have been positioning ourselves to return to growth for a period of time as well. We've been building our online business, and our shares there are equal in size to our brick-and-mortar shares. Importantly, we've been rebuilding our mid-tier and department store business within the doors and with the accounts that remain. And we spoke as early as Q4 about some of our Maidenform initiatives. And then in Q1, we focused on Bali and putting advertising behind that. We're seeing progress out of both of those. And certainly, those are important drivers of the sequential improvement in the bra performance. Within this quarter, we also launched a number of our Maidenform initiatives, in particular in the mass channel, we're seeing nice traction there early on from a POS standpoint. So all of this tells us that we're moving in the right direction, and we see our shares stabilizing as well. That also tells us that we're gaining ground on our problem. Now when we look at Q3 and beyond, shapewear is the next area of focus for us, and we have a number of resets around those businesses in the third quarter that will then correct that piece of the business we feel. So we do feel that we're on track to deliver on the sequential improvement we expect out of the intimates business through the year. Great. And then in the Activewear, I think you mentioned constraints in the mass channel, which it sounds like a mature business, assuming, obviously, there's tough compares from last year. Maybe if you could also give some color though just on the sporting goods channel and department stores. Are you seeing any space gains there? Or how the Champion product is performing there? Oh, yes. We're seeing space gains across-the-board in Champion outside of the mass channel. And certainly, it's a very strong performance in the specialty channel as well as department store and sporting goods. And so there's just nothing but good things to say about the Champion business. And outside the mass, we're looking at a 50% increase in the U.S. market in the quarter. So I actually just want to follow up on that same comment on the U.S. mass channel for Champion, which I think is concentrated largely with one customer, and the idea of it being mature. Can you just help us think about the long-range growth assumptions that you have for that business and also remind us how much of U.S. Champion is currently sold in the mass channel? Well, from a standpoint of the mass initiatives, that was one of our early growth drivers in our Champion business. It's a great partnership. It's been built as a partnership for many years, over 15 years in the market, and then continue -- has some of its best product line ever out now, and the productivity continues to improve. So we feel really good about that program and expect to feel good about it for many years to come. From the standpoint of the total Champion brand though, the Champion brand has evolved very -- has evolved significantly over time, from the standpoint of the many avenues it has to grow. So today, roughly 80% of that business is outside of the mass channel around the world, and we have -- and we are seeing double-digit growth, as you heard, high-teen growth outside the mass channel. So over time, the math would suggest that we would mix more into those other channels and mass will become a smaller piece of the total business. Perfect. And then just a quick follow up on MA. I think you've talked about getting back to the high end of your net leverage range by the end of the year and being within the range next year. Should we think about a pause in MA as you focus on kind of taking down leverage? Or are you going to be similarly opportunistic if deals come up as we've seen in the past? Yes. Over the past -- let me just say first that acquisitions remain an important part of our long-term strategy. Now we have made 10 acquisitions since 2013. That's a strategy to diversify our business, including 2 in the past 6 months. And that's allowed us to become less dependent on the U.S. wholesale market and establish multiple paths for consistent organic growth that you're seeing the power of now through the last 3 quarters. We're really comfortable with these acquisitions that we made and believe we've positioned our portfolio well as well as created substantial value for our shareholders. But as we've executed this diversification strategy, we've gotten outside of our leverage range. So our focus in the near term is to integrate these acquisitions. We have 6 integrations underway right now. And as we do, we'll reduce the charges from these acquisitions, recognize the synergies and let the full cash flow show through. We planned to, at the same, to pay down our debt to get back within our average target, and we expect to be within that leverage range in the latter half of 2019. Gerald, could you please quantify the early placement of Champion in the first quarter? What was pulled from 2Q into 1Q? Yes. This is Barry. I can take that one. We estimate that it was about $15 million on a worldwide basis because some of that was even on the international side. And while I'm talking about that, I'd just note that FX did also come in a little better than we thought so that was about $7 million to $8 million versus what we had put into the guidance for the first quarter, not a lot of profit on that, I might add. And as you'd note, the U.S. dollar has strengthened some here recently. So our foreign exchange tailwind to sales is unchanged in the guidance for the full year. And then our Bras N Things acquisition came in -- oh, just closed slightly earlier than we thought. So we've got a little bit more revenue from that. So if you -- absent those items and the seasonal Champion item that you asked about and FX is really a timing item within the year, so to speak, absent those items, we really were at the high end of our first quarter sales guidance, and we feel very good about how the year has begun. That's very helpful. And inventory was up 9% on a year-over-year basis. Can you talk a little bit about how the mix is there? How comfortable you are in the aggregate inventory level? Yes. Thanks for the question because I do want to clarify that some. If you look at our inventory over last year, a couple of things that I would want to call out. Foreign exchange essentially justifies the entire increase. If not for FX rates, inventory would have been essentially flat. And then acquisitions contributed about $25 million to inventory year-over-year with the 2 deals we've done. So our base inventory, if you look at it, is actually down, and we feel good about the progress we're making there. From when I look at cash cycle, our inventory days improved about 5 days, and that's good improvement. We've got more opportunity there over time. This is Nancy on for Ike. I know you mentioned a little bit about Activewear in the U.S. mass business, but can you just talk about your outlook for the U.S. mass business more broadly, including innerwear? And how you see Activewear playing out for the rest of the year? And then if you could just talk about global Champion, how big is it today? Where can it go? Just talk about the sustainability of Champion on a global basis. So let me begin with the mass question. From the standpoint of our mass innerwear business, it continues to perform very well. We continue to expand the shares in areas such as our basics that we commented in our call. From the standpoint of the Activewear business, there was some space adjustment in our Hanes Activewear business in the quarter that was built into our guidance. And it's really part of our strategy to focus on the branded segments of Activewear and deemphasize commodity elements. There was a portion of that business that was more basic tees and so forth, and we are aware that our customer would be moving that segment to private label. So it's in line with our expectations from the standpoint of guidance. From the standpoint of Champion, as I noted, Champion has many growth avenues beyond the mass channel. Now we expect the growth really to come from those channels as we go forward, and mass will become a smaller share of the total Champion business. For those of us sitting here in the United States with limited visibility abroad, can you just give us some additional color around the drivers of the 7% organic constant-currency growth and the runway for those businesses going forward? Yes, thanks for the question. When we look at our International business, really, and Gerald highlighted this in some of his prepared remarks, it's much about Champion. It's broad-based, but Champion is growing very well across the world, whether it be in Europe or Asia. And that is the principal driver of the growth, and we feel very good about how that started the year and the opportunity going forward. There has been a lot of discussion in private label. You mentioned that in the call with your Activewear. Can you -- do you think about the different categories and your major players? How you feel the balance of private label is to your categories now, whether it be the socks on Amazon? And how you feel the categories is progressing on that front? Sure. From the standpoint of private label, there's always been an element of private label in our categories, and it's an effort that retailers take from time to time to differentiate themselves. Now we've always noted our categories are heavily branded. And in a category like innerwear, they tend to be 80% to 90% branded. Interesting enough is we were just doing some work that we'll talk more about it on our Investor Day that over the last 5 years, we looked across geographies, the branded element has actually grown and private labels declined, and they were across multiple geographies. So I think that speaks to the strength of brands, and we see that as the millennials come on as consumers, they prefer brands equally to boomers and so we're continuing to focus on connecting with that emerging consumer base through our marketing and media as well as our consumer-driven innovation and continue to drive our brand shares. On the Activewear side, we have taken the approach of focusing on the branded segments of Activewear and de-emphasizing the commodity segments over time. And I think, there, you see the power of our Champion initiative as well as our adding a brand like Alternative. It really gave us a number of tools to bring that strategy to bear. And our shares are growing, and we think that our consumer equities are building. When you look at our brands, they're equally strong among the younger consumer and the older consumer, and it's clear to us that brands matter in our categories and we've got a great portfolio to compete with. Okay, that's great. And just one more question on where you feel the channel is on inventory levels and de-stocking? It has been an issue kind of in the past, and I know the mass channel continues to be focused on it. Do you feel that stabilized? Or is there more kind of legs to go? We do feel that the mass channel is stabilized. We've seen them -- that channel very effectively tighten their inventory behind over the last few years to get that in line, and we think it is in line. They've improved their turns very dramatically and are very effective now at managing their inventory, and we think it's well positioned. This is Krista on behalf of John. Two questions. I think you previously guided fiscal 2018 gross margin expansion to up about 100 to 200 basis points. It looks like in the frequently asked questions document, it's around 100 basis points now. So that sort of implies quite an outside gain in the second half. I wonder if you could share with us kind of the various components that will drive that expansion, be it IMU, the supply chain benefits you're expecting, et cetera. And then I have 1 follow-up. Okay, sure. This is Barry. Thanks for that question. In the first quarter, the gross margin was down very slightly about 10 basis points and not a significant variance really to what we were expecting. We saw a little bit of the earlier raw material but not much and not much change in the relative mix of the business either versus what we were thinking. If we look out over the course of the rest of the year, then you get a little bit better international mix. Of course, we have a larger contribution from our new acquisition, Bras N Things, which has a very nice gross margin in that business. We start to see the benefit later in the year of the pricing that we spoke about. That's all secured. That helps -- starts to help offset the inflation that we've talked about. And those will be sort of the principal drivers. We also, of course, will expect to see some more synergy benefit that will play out largely in the International segment. As we talked about before, we feel very good about seeing those international margins meet or, in fact, exceed the corporate average over time, as the synergies continue to play out. And then, I'll just note that in the second half, we certainly expect to see the total company's operating margin expand. So we feel good about how that's playing out at this stage. Okay. And then how should we think about innovation or your launch cadence in Innerwear and Activewear in the second half of 2018, especially as it relates to your back-to-school strategy? Well, we made a pretty big innovation launch in March, and that was our ComfortFlex Fit underwear launch. And you'll see that as an important part of our focus through back-to-school as well, very impactful campaign supported by digital activities and influencers. And we're seeing nice traction out of that launch, and we will continue to ramp that through the balance of the year. I was hoping you could just touch base on the labor inefficiencies. What you've done thus far to fix the problem? And how you think you, I guess, can put out better margins in the fourth quarter as you go against this? What are you doing with your workers to be more efficient? Sure. A couple of questions there that I'll unpack. What we're experiencing right now is the fact that the Champion demand is so strong, as Gerald mentioned, outside of mass growing 50% or more in the U.S. that we have some temporary labor inefficiencies in the distribution centers. And so we are staffing. We've been staffing up with some temporary and moving to permanent. We're also working to expand the network, and all of that is in process. We talked about some of that on the last call, and that's one of the reasons why we think we will get this behind us here in the first half and begin to have that be less of an impact, if not no impact in the second half. The other element that you mentioned in the fourth quarter that impacted us on distribution cost that we talked about before was in the factor that we were seeing some retailers move their orders closer to promotional periods. And that was something that impacted us in the fourth quarter as we have the holiday. And as we talked about last quarter, we certainly expect to have the staffing in an optimal position in front of all holidays going forward. So I think we're in a good place as it relates to the work we're doing there. And then just a follow-up on an earlier question with regards to the gross margin guidance. The fact that last quarter, you said 100 to 200, and now you're saying up 100. Do you think you could still hit the high end of the expectation you, I guess, provided last quarter? Or are there some new incremental headwinds from that line? Yes. So we said -- and I think in the FAQ at least 100, and not to parse it too tightly, I would just note looking in the first quarter, on the original guidance, we were suggesting that it would be up, I believe I used the word slightly on the last call, which was in the vicinity of 10 or 20 basis points, and we came in about 10 down so not a big variance. But as we work through the year, since we weren't adjusting the guidance much, we did take the opportunity to just note that we think the gross margin will be up at least 100. Is it conceivable? It could be up more than that. Certainly, we use the word deliberately as it relates to at least. So we feel good about the fact that we've secured the pricing that we talked about. We have nice synergies coming through the model. We've got that mix that I mentioned before. So it's -- and I think we've got the raw material called appropriately. First on SGA, it looks like about $5 million of first quarter's SGA from last year was moved down to the other expense line. Maybe you could parse out further the drivers for this decision. And then second, should we assume about $5 million of SGA per quarter for 2017 to create an apples-to-apples comparison? Yes. So on our last call, we did mention that we were adjusting pension expense for the change in FASB and accounting rules related to pension. So that is now in Other. And we had disclosed that, I believe, in our K and the recasted historical financials reflect that. So you should expect that's correct that I think our total pension last year was about $20 million, and that's essentially on a quarterly basis. So you're right. Okay. And then second question, I wanted to follow up on the reiterated full year cash flow from operations guide. I think cash flow from operations was down 128 for the quarter with -- due to various puts and takes. Curious to know if you have any directional guidance. And if we should see the second quarter cash flow from operations up relative to last year or should we see it more back-end weighted? Okay. Cash flow from operations for the company is playing out just as we expected. Q1 was very much in line with our expectations. So we continue to expect the full year to be in the $675 million to $750 million for the full year. I would note that the first quarter cash flow from operations does include that earn-out payment on the Champion Europe acquisition due to the way accounting treatment steps in working capital. And so as I look at the full year, we certainly would expect the second quarter to be sort of a typical seasonality. We don't see any variance. So you'd have naturally more of the cash flow in the back half, as you know the company well. But broadly speaking, working capital in the first quarter was just as planned and seasonal. We have that few days of improvement in cash cycle from the inventory that I mentioned, and we feel good about the cash flow from operations for the year. This is May Nin on for Carla. We just wanted a little bit more clarity on the distribution cost that you highlighted. Is there anything that -- of note that we should know about, whether it was like shipping costs? Was it there -- was it driven by an increase in Champion sales or anything like that? And I know that you mentioned that it's going to normalize into 2Q or later this year. Should that be relatively even? Okay. Thanks for the question. Let me clarify some of that. When we're talking about distribution, in this case, it's really inside our distribution centers and within our network. It's not in the form of freight. Although you see a little bit of kind of ocean freight, et cetera, being a factor. However, from a distribution standpoint, really, we're talking about the labor-driven inefficiencies we talked about earlier on the call and last quarter. And as it relates to how that will even out, we really do expect there to still be -- and it's embedded in the guidance, some elevated level of distribution cost here in the second quarter, and by the back half, it could be more normalized to levels that are embedded in the guide.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"culture_integrity\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0.00010387243983233525,\n        \"min\": 0.0,\n        \"max\": 0.0003663003663003663,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 8,\n        \"samples\": [\n          0.00011303266644060134,\n          0.000169061707523246,\n          0.0\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"culture_teamwork\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0.0005424332182934677,\n        \"min\": 0.00010154346060113728,\n        \"max\": 0.002208353336533845,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 20,\n        \"samples\": [\n          0.00010828370330265295,\n          0.0002775978532432682,\n          0.0008193842912325881\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"culture_innovation\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0.0009658836878842093,\n        \"min\": 9.601536245799327e-05,\n        \"max\": 0.003043427367435327,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 20,\n        \"samples\": [\n          0.00032485110990795884,\n          0.0029610437679281946,\n          0.003043427367435327\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"culture_respect\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0.00014339631462542945,\n        \"min\": 0.0,\n        \"max\": 0.00047036688617121356,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 5,\n        \"samples\": [\n          0.00010981770261366133,\n          0.0004626630887387804,\n          7.925186241876684e-05\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"culture_quality\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 6.705020493623793e-05,\n        \"min\": 0.0,\n        \"max\": 0.00022251891410769915,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 6,\n        \"samples\": [\n          0.0,\n          7.925186241876684e-05,\n          0.00010662117496534811\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}",

        "low-dimensional space of two or three dimensions. It is popular for reducing dimensions\n",
        "while preserving the local structure of the data, making it easier to visualize clusters\n",
        "and patterns.\n",
        "\n",
        "One of the key parameters in t-SNE is 'perplexity', which can be thought of as a\n",
        "smooth measure of the effective number of neighbors. It is a crucial parameter that\n",
        "balances attention between local and global aspects of your data. A smaller perplexity\n",
        "focuses more on local data structure, while a larger perplexity captures a broader\n",
        "global structure. The choice of perplexity can significantly affect the resulting\n",
        "visualization, and it often requires some experimentation to find the optimal value.\n",

        "In the realm of natural language processing, word embeddings are a crucial component for understanding and processing human language. They are dense vector representations of words that capture semantic meanings, relationships, and contexts. Training word embeddings from scratch can be computationally expensive and time-consuming, especially when dealing with large datasets. This is where pre-trained word embeddings come into play. Pre-trained word embeddings are models that have been previously trained on extensive corpora, such as Wikipedia or news articles, and are readily available for use. These embeddings encapsulate a wealth of linguistic information and can be directly applied to various NLP tasks, saving both time and computational resources.\n",

Unlike other models that rely on local context, GloVe constructs a word vector space where the geometric relationships between words reflect their semantic similarities and differences. This model is particularly effective for tasks that require understanding the nuanced meanings and relationships between words, making it a valuable tool in natural language processing applications."

        "2. **Data Size and Domain:**  \n",
        "   - Fine-tuning is most effective when your additional corpus is sufficiently large and similar in domain to the original training data.  \n",

        "   - Make sure to adjust parameters like the learning rate appropriately during fine-tuning.  \n",

        " Doc2Vec (also known as Paragraph Vector) is an extension of Word2Vec designed to learn fixed-length vector representations for larger bodies of text—like sentences, paragraphs, or entire documents. While Word2Vec focuses on individual words by predicting context words, Doc2Vec incorporates a unique document identifier (or “tag”) during training. This additional document vector is trained jointly with the word vectors to capture the overall context and semantics of the document.\n",

        "\n",
        "- **Learning Document Representations Directly:**  \n",
        "  Instead of deriving a document representation by simply averaging the embeddings of its words—a method that ignores word order and the interactions between words—Doc2Vec learns a vector specifically for each document. This vector is optimized to help predict words in the document, leading to richer representations.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Preserving Word Order and Context:**  \n",
        "  Averaging word embeddings treats a document as a “bag of words,” discarding any notion of word order. In contrast, Doc2Vec (especially in its Distributed Memory (DM) model) uses the document vector alongside context words to predict a target word, which helps maintain some information about the order and structure of the text.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Two Main Approaches:**  \n",
        "  - **Distributed Memory (DM):** Similar to the Continuous Bag-of-Words (CBOW) model in Word2Vec, this approach predicts a target word given both context words and a document identifier.  \n",
        "  - **Distributed Bag of Words (DBOW):** This approach ignores context words during training and learns the document vector by predicting random words from the document (akin to a skip-gram model for documents).\n",
        "\n",
        "In summary, while averaging word embeddings can be a simple baseline to represent a document, it often loses valuable context and structure. Doc2Vec provides a more nuanced representation by learning document-specific vectors that capture the broader semantics and word relationships within the text.\n",
